abstract = {Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease characterized by an abnormal ventilation response that limiting the exercise tolerance. Current evidence shows that physical training increases exercise capacity, decreases disnea and improves quality of life in patients with CF. Adherence to respiratory rehabilitation programs is a key factor to guarantee optimal benefits. Our goal was to determine the efficiency of three Nintendo Wii video game as training systems by measuring the physiologic response of performing different exercises with CF patients. Method: we included 24CF patients [mean+SD: age: 12+3.7 years; BMI: 18+3; FVC: 97+20\%; FEV1:93+20\%] followed 4 different exercise types in randomized order during six minutes: (1) 6-min walking test (6MWT); (2) Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii-Fit); (3) Nintendo Wii Active (Wii-Acti), and (4) Nintendo Wii Family Trainner (Wii-Train). All physiologic responses were recorded breath by breath by using a portable gas analyzer (Fitmate Pro, Cosmed, Italy). Results: In all video game exercises, after the 3th minute, all physiological variables describe a plateau profile that remains stable until the end of the test, similar to the 6MWT. The Wii-Acti and Wii-Train obtained high and significative values compared with the 6MWT. Conclusion: From a physiological perspective, exercises executed with video game platforms are feasible and allow high intensity time-sustained exercise. This type of training could be recommended to the patients CF and can induce important physiologic improvements when used as a training method.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Exercise is an important treatment modality for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but factors influencing adherence have been examined infrequently. The purpose of this investigation was to explore adherence factors to a progressive resistance exercise program for persons with COPD. METHODS: Persons with COPD enrolled in a 12-week trial of progressive resistance exercise were invited to participate in 2 semistructured qualitative interviews exploring program adherence. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and then coded independently by 2 researchers. Themes relating to short-term and long-term adherence were then developed and described. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were interviewed at the conclusion of the intervention (12 weeks), and 19 completed a second interview at 24 weeks. Short-term exercise adherence was facilitated by expected outcomes, self-motivation, supervision, and group support, whereas health and weather factors were the major barriers to adherence. The barriers to exercise remained unchanged at 24 weeks despite a large decline in exercise adherence. Removal of environmental support at 12 weeks may have contributed to poor long-term exercise maintenance, with participants identifying group support and regular monitoring by a therapist as the most important strategies for maintaining exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of external support in training program design appears important for persons with COPD. Longer-term adherence declined when group support and regular monitoring by a therapist was removed, despite the major perceived exercise barriers remaining unchanged. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine effective strategies for maximizing longer-term exercise adherence in this population.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and mean oscillated volume (V(osc)) during high frequency chest compression (HFCC). DESIGN: A clinic-based prospective intervention study. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. POPULATION: Nine children with cystic fibrosis with little or no obstructive airway disease who were selected from the outpatient Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonary Clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. METHODS: Each child received HFCC alone (at 10 Hz with chest wall pressure of 8 cm H2O) and HFCC plus PEEP. A closed circuit spirometry system was used to measure HFCC- and PEEP-induced changes in EELV, expressed as per cent baseline functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using helium dilution. An isothermic chamber permitted measurement of V(osc). RESULTS: HFCC caused a significant 9\% decrease in EELV. Adding 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O of PEEP increased EELV back to at least the FRC level. With HFCC alone, Vosc was significantly lower during spontaneous expiration than during spontaneous inspiration, but adding PEEP to HFCC increased V(osc), especially during spontaneous expiration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PEEP during HFCC prevents the decrease in EELV and increases V(osc). Therefore, PEEP may improve HFCC-induced mucus clearance in children with cystic fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as "game only" or "control" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each > 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P ≤ .1, significance at P < .05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26\%) and control periods (32\%). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = .07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = .71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV(1), though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV(1) from baseline (r = 0.50, P = .09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned.},

abstract = {Background: Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50\%. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50\% for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27\% to 46\%. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Drawing on the co-construction of technology and society perspective, it focuses more specifically on the way in which innovation designers envisage the enhancement of the chronically ill and build certain kinds of socio-technical configuration to deal with chronic illness. Using the case of ;intelligent distance patient monitoring' as an illustration, the paper argues that technology creates as much as it solves the problem of chronic illness. Technology is recursively embedded in chronic illness and it generates dual effects: it constrains and sustains users' daily practices. Only by recognizing technology's duality and eventually transcending it will research and policy initiatives be able to deal creatively and responsibly with the design of our future health experiences.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how medical specialists view health technology assessment (HTA) and its role in policy-making. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 28 medical specialists practising in Quebec and Ontario (Canada) to examine their views on an HTA report relevant to their specialty (prostate-specific antigen screening, electroconvulsive therapy and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome). RESULTS: Medical specialists represent a particularly demanding audience for HTA producers because they are knowledgeable about current studies in their field and often contribute to the evidence base that HTA seeks to synthesize. In all three cases, specialists not only challenged specific points in the content of the HTA reports but also offered different and sometimes conflicting appraisals of the clinical relevance and policy implications. More than just the timeliness and usefulness of HTA findings are at issue. The views of specialists are grounded in a clinical understanding of what counts as evidence and how decisions should be made, a view that contrasts with the societal perspective of HTA. CONCLUSIONS: HTA producers cannot afford to overlook medical specialists who play a key role in the adoption of health technologies. Establishing a transparent dialogue between producers and users of HTA reports could enrich policy recommendations.},

Although the value of regular airway clearance treatments has been shown in many studies, adherence to the prescribed treatments is not very good (see Making airway clearance successful, pp. 000-000). In the past the only method available was conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT; also known as manual percussion and postural drainage). CCPT remains the 'gold standard' of airway clearance methods and may be the best choice for some patients, such as infants and young children. However, the many newer methods of airway clearance available now allow CF patients and their families to choose the techniques and devices that best suits them. Most of the newer airway clearance devices have been studied in comparison to standard chest physiotherapy and most studies show no advantage of one method over another. This review will describe newer airway clearance devices available for CF patients and discuss evidence for the effectiveness of these devices compared to standard chest physiotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The clearance of secretions from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an important component in the fight to preserve their lung function. There is excessive inflammation in the airways of these patients, which is thought to be exaggerated by ineffective mucociliary clearance and bacterial infection. In 2005 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed the Pulmonary Therapies Committee to review all of the medical literature on the various airway-clearance therapies used in treating CF lung disease. The recommendations were: an airway-clearance therapy should be performed by all patients with CF, no form of airway-clearance therapy stood out as being superior to another, and that patients may express a preference of one therapy over another. They also concluded that aerobic exercise is beneficial to patients with CF, as it is to everyone, and that exercise should be a component to the overall health routine of patients with CF. The challenge for respiratory and physical therapists together with the patient/family is to develop a plan of attack through the use of various airway-clearance therapies. The respiratory and physical therapists are integral in helping patients and families develop airway-clearance routines that aid in the removal of the secretions that cause airway obstruction. There is a wide range of airway-clearance therapies that therapists can choose from when they are teaching the patients and family members the strategies of secretion removal. The questions are: What therapy is best for what age or stage of lung disease? What therapies will the patient do? And which therapies will be covered by medical insurance? These are all fundamental questions that must be answered when guiding families in finding therapies that are effective and appropriate for each CF patient's unique situation.},

abstract = {The field of rehabilitation has increasingly adopted commercially available games using perceptual interfaces as a means for physically training patients. The adaptability of such systems to match each person's need and rehabilitation goal remains problematic. This paper presents a rapid prototyping approach for customising gaming technology using various affordable commercial devices and open source software. We first demonstrate how a freely available game is adapted for training disabled people through different sensors and control modes. We then show how an open online virtual world such as Second Life ® offers sufficient conditions for quickly building custom content for testing with interactive devices. When presented with these prototyping possibilities, people from the target groups (healthcare professionals, patients, people with disabilities, older people, families) related such systems to their needs and further elaborated on the use of such systems. Our research indicates how availability of simple prototyping platforms expands upon the possibilities for developers and practitioners. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · New York.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Problems with sleep, eating and adherence to therapy may adversely affect health outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6\%; moderate/large problem: 21.9\%), eating (32.4\%) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4\%). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3\%), anxiety (16.4\%) and stress (34.2\%). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95\% CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease characterized by an abnormal ventilation response that limiting the exercise tolerance. Current evidence shows that physical training increases exercise capacity, decreases disnea and improves quality of life in patients with CF. Adherence to respiratory rehabilitation programs is a key factor to guarantee optimal benefits. Our goal was to determine the efficiency of three Nintendo Wii video game as training systems by measuring the physiologic response of performing different exercises with CF patients. Method: we included 24CF patients [mean+SD: age: 12+3.7 years; BMI: 18+3; FVC: 97+20\%; FEV1:93+20\%] followed 4 different exercise types in randomized order during six minutes: (1) 6-min walking test (6MWT); (2) Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii-Fit); (3) Nintendo Wii Active (Wii-Acti), and (4) Nintendo Wii Family Trainner (Wii-Train). All physiologic responses were recorded breath by breath by using a portable gas analyzer (Fitmate Pro, Cosmed, Italy). Results: In all video game exercises, after the 3th minute, all physiological variables describe a plateau profile that remains stable until the end of the test, similar to the 6MWT. The Wii-Acti and Wii-Train obtained high and significative values compared with the 6MWT. Conclusion: From a physiological perspective, exercises executed with video game platforms are feasible and allow high intensity time-sustained exercise. This type of training could be recommended to the patients CF and can induce important physiologic improvements when used as a training method.},

abstract = {Question: Does exercise using a gaming console result in similar cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure as formally prescribed exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis? How do these patients perceive gaming console exercise? Design: Randomised cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 19 adults with cystic fibrosis admitted to hospital for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Intervention: Participants underwent two 15-minute exercise interventions on separate days; one involving a gaming console and one a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Outcome measures: Cardiovascular demand was measured using heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Energy expenditure was estimated using a portable activity monitor. Perception (enjoyment, fatigue, workload, effectiveness, feasibility) was rated using a horizontal 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: There was no significant difference in average heart rate (mean difference 3 beats/min, 95\% Cl -3 to 9) or energy expenditure (0.1 MET, 95\% Cl -0.3 to 0.5) between the two interventions. Both interventions provided a 'hard' workout (RPE \~{}15). Gaming console exercise was rated as more enjoyable (mean difference 2.6 cm, 95\% CI 1.6 to 3.6) than formal exercise but they didn't differ significantly in fatigue (-1.0 cm, 95\% CI -2.4 to 0.3), perceived effectiveness (-0.4 cm, 95\% CI -1.2 to 0.3), or perceived feasibility for inclusion in routine management (0.2 cm, 95\% CI -0.7 to 1.1). Conclusion: Gaming console exercise provides a similar cardiovascular demand as traditional exercise modalities. It is feasible that adults with cystic fibrosis could include gaming console exercise in their exercise program. Trial registration: ACTRN12610000861055. ??

abstract = {Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to 'transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.},

@article{Elkins2006b,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis.Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6\% ± 24.0\% and 66.5\% ± 31.2\%, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6\% and 79.1\%, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7\% vs. 78.4\%, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

DESIGN: A clinic-based prospective intervention study. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. POPULATION: Nine children with cystic fibrosis with little or no obstructive airway disease who were selected from the outpatient Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonary Clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. METHODS: Each child received HFCC alone (at 10 Hz with chest wall pressure of 8 cm H2O) and HFCC plus PEEP. A closed circuit spirometry system was used to measure HFCC- and PEEP-induced changes in EELV, expressed as per cent baseline functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using helium dilution. An isothermic chamber permitted measurement of V(osc). RESULTS: HFCC caused a significant 9\% decrease in EELV. Adding 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O of PEEP increased EELV back to at least the FRC level. With HFCC alone, Vosc was significantly lower during spontaneous expiration than during spontaneous inspiration, but adding PEEP to HFCC increased V(osc), especially during spontaneous expiration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PEEP during HFCC prevents the decrease in EELV and increases V(osc). Therefore, PEEP may improve HFCC-induced mucus clearance in children with cystic fibrosis.},

The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50\% for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27\% to 46\%. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

abstract = {The field of rehabilitation has increasingly adopted commercially available games using perceptual interfaces as a means for physically training patients. The adaptability of such systems to match each person's need and rehabilitation goal remains problematic. This paper presents a rapid prototyping approach for customising gaming technology using various affordable commercial devices and open source software. We first demonstrate how a freely available game is adapted for training disabled people through different sensors and control modes. We then show how an open online virtual world such as Second Life ® offers sufficient conditions for quickly building custom content for testing with interactive devices. When presented with these prototyping possibilities, people from the target groups (healthcare professionals, patients, people with disabilities, older people, families) related such systems to their needs and further elaborated on the use of such systems. Our research indicates how availability of simple prototyping platforms expands upon the possibilities for developers and practitioners. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · New York.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active video games (AVGs) have gained interest as a way to increase physical activity in children and youth. The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.},

However, the exercise intensity associated with playing these games has not been examined in this population. Methods: Children with cystic fibrosis [n=30, aged 12.3 (2.6) years, 17 boys, BMI 17.7 (2.8) kg/m2] were recruited from outpatient clinics in Dublin hospitals. Age and gender matched control children were recruited from local schools. Oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents (METs) calculated from resting V̇O2, and heart rate were measured while playing Nintendo Wii™ (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) Sports Boxing and Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging using a portable indirect calorimeter (Oxycon Mobile). Results: Playing Wii Boxing resulted in light intensity activity (2.46. METs) while playing Wii Fit Free Jogging resulted in moderate intensity physical activity (4.44. METs). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing active video games. Conclusion: Active video games are a useful source of light to moderate intensity physical activity in children with cystic fibrosis. © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Interactive design interviews were carried out with 20 adolescent users of the acapella?? physiotherapy device to investigate user requirements and themes about the user-device relationship that are important to this user group. This study found that adolescent users of the acapella?? device do not use the device as regularly and correctly as is recommended by clinicians. A number of aspects of the current design of the acapella?? device were identified that affect how and how often it is used. Five factors are identified that may improve the real world effectiveness of the acapella?? device for adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis: engagement, information, confidence, aesthetics and compatibility with lifestyle. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60\% of the patients and by 62\% of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},

Adopting a conceptual framework that brings together two research perspectives, i.e. the sociology of technology and the sociology of illness, this paper empirically examines why and how patients use health technology at home and in the broader social world. Our study compares and contrasts the use of four interventions: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. We conducted interviews with patients (n = 16) and caregivers (n = 6), and made direct observations of home visits by nurses (n = 16). The content and structure of patient manuals distributed by major manufacturers and hospitals were analysed (n = 26). The aim of our study was to determine how technology was supposed to be used versus how it was actually used. This study shows that patients are deeply ambivalent about the benefits and drawbacks of technology, and that these advantages and disadvantages are shaped by the various places in which the technology is used. While technology can be pivotal in making patients autonomous and able to participate in the social world, it also imposes heavy restrictions that are intimately interwoven with the nature of the particular disease and with the patient's personal life trajectory.},

METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

We review current research on the effect of action video game training on visual attention and visuospatial processing, executive functions, and learning and memory. Focusing on studies that utilize strict experimental controls and synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological data, we examine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between action video game training and beneficial changes in cognition. Convergent lines of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence tentatively support the efficacy of training, but the magnitude and specificity of these effects remain obscure. Causal inference is thus far limited by a lack of standardized and well-controlled methodology. Considering future directions, we suggest stringent adherence to evidence-based practices and collaboration modeled after clinical trial networks. Finally, we recommend the exploration of more complex causal models, such as indirect causal relationships and interactions that may be masking true effects.},

Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Therefore, this preliminary investigation described responses in distribution of ventilation and gas mixing to PEP breathing for patients with moderate to severe CF lung disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of PEP breathing on ventilation distribution, gas mixing, lung volumes, expiratory airflow, percentage of arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), and sputum volume were studied in 5 patients with CF (mean age=18 years, SD=4, range=13-22) after no-PEP, low-PEP (10-20 cm H(2)O), and high-PEP (>20 cm H(2)O) breathing conditions. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. Single-breath tests assess ventilation distribution homogeneity and gas mixing by observing the extent to which an inspired test gas mixes with gas already residing in the lung. RESULTS: Improvements in gas mixing were observed in all PEP conditions. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5\%, the low-PEP group improved by 15\%, and the high-PEP group improved by 23\%. Slow vital capacity increased by 1\% for no PEP, by 9\% for low PEP, and by 13\% for high PEP 45 minutes after intervention. Residual volume decreased by 13\% after no PEP, by 20\% after low PEP, and by 30\% after high PEP. Immediate improvements in forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity maneuver (FEF(25\%-75\%)) were sustained following high PEP but not following low PEP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The results confirm that low PEP and high PEP improve gas mixing in individuals with CF, and these improvements were associated with increased lung function, sputum expectoration, and SpO(2). The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.},

abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the use of specialised medical equipment by patients at home has increased in most industrialised countries. Adopting a conceptual framework that brings together two research perspectives, i.e. the sociology of technology and the sociology of illness, this paper empirically examines why and how patients use health technology at home and in the broader social world. Our study compares and contrasts the use of four interventions: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. We conducted interviews with patients (n = 16) and caregivers (n = 6), and made direct observations of home visits by nurses (n = 16). The content and structure of patient manuals distributed by major manufacturers and hospitals were analysed (n = 26). The aim of our study was to determine how technology was supposed to be used versus how it was actually used. This study shows that patients are deeply ambivalent about the benefits and drawbacks of technology, and that these advantages and disadvantages are shaped by the various places in which the technology is used. While technology can be pivotal in making patients autonomous and able to participate in the social world, it also imposes heavy restrictions that are intimately interwoven with the nature of the particular disease and with the patient's personal life trajectory.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to examine the safety and efficacy of airway clearance devices (ACDs) for cystic fibrosis and attempt to differentiate between devices, where possible, on grounds of clinical efficacy, quality of life, safety and/or patient preference. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, inherited, life-limiting disease that affects multiple systems of the human body. Respiratory dysfunction is the primary complication and leading cause of death due to CF. CF causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging, which in turn can lead to bacterial infection and further mucous production. Over time, this almost cyclical process contributes to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Removal of airway secretions, termed airway clearance, is thus an integral component of the management of CF. A variety of methods are available for airway clearance, some requiring mechanical devices, others physical manipulation of the body (e.g. physiotherapy). Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), through the assistance of a caregiver, is the current standard of care for achieving airway clearance, particularly in young patients up to the ages of six or seven. CF patients are, however, living much longer now than in decades past. The median age of survival in Canada has risen to 37.0 years for the period of 1998-2002 (5-year window), up from 22.8 years for the 5-year window ending in 1977. The prevalence has also risen accordingly, last recorded as 3,453 in Canada in 2002, up from 1,630 in 1977. With individuals living longer, there is a greater need for independent methods of airway clearance. AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CLASSES OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: positive expiratory pressure devices (PEP), airway oscillating devices (AOD; either handheld or stationary) and high frequency chest compression (HFCC)/mechanical percussion (MP) devices. Within these classes are numerous different brands of devices from various manufacturers, each with subtle iterations. At least 10 devices are licensed by Health Canada (ranging from Class 1 to Class 3 devices). EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does long-term use of ACDs improve outcomes of interest in comparison to CCPT in patients with CF?Does long-term use of one class of ACD improve outcomes of interest in comparison to another class of ACD in CF patients? LITERATURE SEARCH: A comprehensive literature search was performed on March 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1950 to March 7, 2009. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials including those of parallel and crossover design,Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Abstracts were generally excluded because their methods could not be examined; however, abstract data was included in several Cochrane meta-analyses presented in this paper;Studies of less than seven days duration (including single treatment studies);Studies that did not report primary outcomes;Studies in which less than 10 patients completed the study. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Primary outcomes under review were percent-predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV-1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25\%-75\% (FEF25-75). Secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, adherence, patient preference, quality of life and adverse events. All outcomes were decided a priori. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Literature searching and back-searching identified 13 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, along with three Cochrane systematic reviews. The Cochrane reviews were identified in preliminary searching and used as the basis for formulating this review. Results were subgrouped by comparison and according to the available literature. For example, results from Cochrane meta-analyses included abstract data and therefore, additional meta-analyses were also performed on trials reported as full publications only (MAS generally excludes abstracted data when full publications are available as the methodological quality of trials reported in abstract cannot be properly assessed). Executive Summary Table 1 summarizes the results across all comparisons and subgroupings for primary outcomes of pulmonary function. Only two comparisons yielded evidence of moderate or high quality according to GRADE criteria-the comparisons of CCPT vs. PEP and handheld AOD vs. PEP-but only the comparison of CCPT vs. PEP noted a significant difference between treatment groups. In comparison to CCPT, there was a significant difference in favour of PEP for \% predicted FEV-1 and FVC according to one long-term, parallel RCT. This trial was accepted as the best available evidence for the comparison. The body of evidence for the remaining comparisons was low to very low, according to GRADE criteria, being downgraded most often because of poor methodological quality and low generalizability. Specifically, trials were likely not adequately powered (low sample sizes), did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses, were conducted primarily in children and young adolescents, and outdated (conducted more than 10 years ago). Secondary outcomes were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were generally not of value to decision-making. Of note, there were a significantly higher number of hospitalizations among participants undergoing AOD therapy in comparison to PEP therapy.

Although the majority of device costs are paid out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their parents, or covered by third-party medical insurance, Ontario did provide funding assistance through the Assistive Devices Program (ADP) for postural drainage boards and MP devices. These technologies, however, are either obsolete or their clinical efficacy is not supported by evidence. ADP provided roughly \$16,000 in funding for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Using device costs and prevalent and incident cases of CF in Ontario, budget impact projections were generated for Ontario. Prevalence of CF in Ontario for patients from ages 6 to 71 was cited as 1,047 cases in 2002 while incidence was estimated at 46 new cases of CF diagnosed per year in 2002. Budget impact projections indicated that PEP and handheld AODs were highly economically feasible costing around \$90,000 for the entire prevalent population and less than \$3,000 per year to cover new incident cases. HFCC vest devices were by far the most expensive, costing in excess of \$19 million to cover the prevalent population alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of sufficiently powered, long-term, parallel randomized controlled trials investigating the use of ACDs in comparison to other airway clearance techniques. While much of the current evidence suggests no significant difference between various ACDs and alternative therapies/technologies, at least according to outcomes of pulmonary function, there is a strong possibility that past trials were not sufficiently powered to identify a difference. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing ACDs to CCPT as withholding therapy using an ACD may be seen as unethical at present. Conclusions of clinical effectiveness are as follows: Moderate quality evidence suggests that PEP is at least as effective as or more effective than CCPT, according to primary outcomes of pulmonary function.

Drawing on the co-construction of technology and society perspective, it focuses more specifically on the way in which innovation designers envisage the enhancement of the chronically ill and build certain kinds of socio-technical configuration to deal with chronic illness. Using the case of ;intelligent distance patient monitoring' as an illustration, the paper argues that technology creates as much as it solves the problem of chronic illness. Technology is recursively embedded in chronic illness and it generates dual effects: it constrains and sustains users' daily practices. Only by recognizing technology's duality and eventually transcending it will research and policy initiatives be able to deal creatively and responsibly with the design of our future health experiences.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50\% of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {The clearance of secretions from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an important component in the fight to preserve their lung function. There is excessive inflammation in the airways of these patients, which is thought to be exaggerated by ineffective mucociliary clearance and bacterial infection. In 2005 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed the Pulmonary Therapies Committee to review all of the medical literature on the various airway-clearance therapies used in treating CF lung disease. The recommendations were: an airway-clearance therapy should be performed by all patients with CF, no form of airway-clearance therapy stood out as being superior to another, and that patients may express a preference of one therapy over another. They also concluded that aerobic exercise is beneficial to patients with CF, as it is to everyone, and that exercise should be a component to the overall health routine of patients with CF. The challenge for respiratory and physical therapists together with the patient/family is to develop a plan of attack through the use of various airway-clearance therapies. The respiratory and physical therapists are integral in helping patients and families develop airway-clearance routines that aid in the removal of the secretions that cause airway obstruction. There is a wide range of airway-clearance therapies that therapists can choose from when they are teaching the patients and family members the strategies of secretion removal. The questions are: What therapy is best for what age or stage of lung disease? What therapies will the patient do? And which therapies will be covered by medical insurance? These are all fundamental questions that must be answered when guiding families in finding therapies that are effective and appropriate for each CF patient's unique situation.},

abstract = {Clearance of infected airway secretions is essential to preserve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the value of regular airway clearance treatments has been shown in many studies, adherence to the prescribed treatments is not very good (see Making airway clearance successful, pp. 000-000). In the past the only method available was conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT; also known as manual percussion and postural drainage). CCPT remains the 'gold standard' of airway clearance methods and may be the best choice for some patients, such as infants and young children. However, the many newer methods of airway clearance available now allow CF patients and their families to choose the techniques and devices that best suits them. Most of the newer airway clearance devices have been studied in comparison to standard chest physiotherapy and most studies show no advantage of one method over another. This review will describe newer airway clearance devices available for CF patients and discuss evidence for the effectiveness of these devices compared to standard chest physiotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Health game research has flourished over the last decade. The number of peer-reviewed scientific publications has surged as the clinical application of health games has diversified. In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer- reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user–game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user–game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatments is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

abstract = {Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to 'transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.},

abstract = {REVIEW DATE: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. OBJECTIVES: Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, 'What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?'. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the 'grey literature' were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. HEADLINE RESULTS: Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback--51 (47\%) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice--43 (39\%) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration--27 (25\%) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level--15 (14\%) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies--11 (10\%) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation--11 (10\%) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment--10 (9\%) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning--10 (9\%) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes--seven (6\%) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity--four (3\%) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. CONCLUSIONS: While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to examine the safety and efficacy of airway clearance devices (ACDs) for cystic fibrosis and attempt to differentiate between devices, where possible, on grounds of clinical efficacy, quality of life, safety and/or patient preference. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, inherited, life-limiting disease that affects multiple systems of the human body. Respiratory dysfunction is the primary complication and leading cause of death due to CF. CF causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging, which in turn can lead to bacterial infection and further mucous production. Over time, this almost cyclical process contributes to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Removal of airway secretions, termed airway clearance, is thus an integral component of the management of CF. A variety of methods are available for airway clearance, some requiring mechanical devices, others physical manipulation of the body (e.g. physiotherapy). Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), through the assistance of a caregiver, is the current standard of care for achieving airway clearance, particularly in young patients up to the ages of six or seven. CF patients are, however, living much longer now than in decades past. The median age of survival in Canada has risen to 37.0 years for the period of 1998-2002 (5-year window), up from 22.8 years for the 5-year window ending in 1977. The prevalence has also risen accordingly, last recorded as 3,453 in Canada in 2002, up from 1,630 in 1977. With individuals living longer, there is a greater need for independent methods of airway clearance. AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CLASSES OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: positive expiratory pressure devices (PEP), airway oscillating devices (AOD; either handheld or stationary) and high frequency chest compression (HFCC)/mechanical percussion (MP) devices. Within these classes are numerous different brands of devices from various manufacturers, each with subtle iterations. At least 10 devices are licensed by Health Canada (ranging from Class 1 to Class 3 devices). EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does long-term use of ACDs improve outcomes of interest in comparison to CCPT in patients with CF?Does long-term use of one class of ACD improve outcomes of interest in comparison to another class of ACD in CF patients? LITERATURE SEARCH: A comprehensive literature search was performed on March 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing \& Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1950 to March 7, 2009. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials including those of parallel and crossover design,Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Abstracts were generally excluded because their methods could not be examined; however, abstract data was included in several Cochrane meta-analyses presented in this paper;Studies of less than seven days duration (including single treatment studies);Studies that did not report primary outcomes;Studies in which less than 10 patients completed the study. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Primary outcomes under review were percent-predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV-1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25\%-75\% (FEF25-75). Secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, adherence, patient preference, quality of life and adverse events. All outcomes were decided a priori. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Literature searching and back-searching identified 13 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, along with three Cochrane systematic reviews. The Cochrane reviews were identified in preliminary searching and used as the basis for formulating this review. Results were subgrouped by comparison and according to the available literature. For example, results from Cochrane meta-analyses included abstract data and therefore, additional meta-analyses were also performed on trials reported as full publications only (MAS generally excludes abstracted data when full publications are available as the methodological quality of trials reported in abstract cannot be properly assessed). Executive Summary Table 1 summarizes the results across all comparisons and subgroupings for primary outcomes of pulmonary function. Only two comparisons yielded evidence of moderate or high quality according to GRADE criteria-the comparisons of CCPT vs. PEP and handheld AOD vs. PEP-but only the comparison of CCPT vs. PEP noted a significant difference between treatment groups. In comparison to CCPT, there was a significant difference in favour of PEP for \% predicted FEV-1 and FVC according to one long-term, parallel RCT. This trial was accepted as the best available evidence for the comparison. The body of evidence for the remaining comparisons was low to very low, according to GRADE criteria, being downgraded most often because of poor methodological quality and low generalizability. Specifically, trials were likely not adequately powered (low sample sizes), did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses, were conducted primarily in children and young adolescents, and outdated (conducted more than 10 years ago). Secondary outcomes were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were generally not of value to decision-making. Of note, there were a significantly higher number of hospitalizations among participants undergoing AOD therapy in comparison to PEP therapy.

Although the majority of device costs are paid out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their parents, or covered by third-party medical insurance, Ontario did provide funding assistance through the Assistive Devices Program (ADP) for postural drainage boards and MP devices. These technologies, however, are either obsolete or their clinical efficacy is not supported by evidence. ADP provided roughly \$16,000 in funding for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Using device costs and prevalent and incident cases of CF in Ontario, budget impact projections were generated for Ontario. Prevalence of CF in Ontario for patients from ages 6 to 71 was cited as 1,047 cases in 2002 while incidence was estimated at 46 new cases of CF diagnosed per year in 2002. Budget impact projections indicated that PEP and handheld AODs were highly economically feasible costing around \$90,000 for the entire prevalent population and less than \$3,000 per year to cover new incident cases. HFCC vest devices were by far the most expensive, costing in excess of \$19 million to cover the prevalent population alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of sufficiently powered, long-term, parallel randomized controlled trials investigating the use of ACDs in comparison to other airway clearance techniques. While much of the current evidence suggests no significant difference between various ACDs and alternative therapies/technologies, at least according to outcomes of pulmonary function, there is a strong possibility that past trials were not sufficiently powered to identify a difference. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing ACDs to CCPT as withholding therapy using an ACD may be seen as unethical at present. Conclusions of clinical effectiveness are as follows: Moderate quality evidence suggests that PEP is at least as effective as or more effective than CCPT, according to primary outcomes of pulmonary function.

The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how medical specialists view health technology assessment (HTA) and its role in policy-making. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 28 medical specialists practising in Quebec and Ontario (Canada) to examine their views on an HTA report relevant to their specialty (prostate-specific antigen screening, electroconvulsive therapy and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome). RESULTS: Medical specialists represent a particularly demanding audience for HTA producers because they are knowledgeable about current studies in their field and often contribute to the evidence base that HTA seeks to synthesize. In all three cases, specialists not only challenged specific points in the content of the HTA reports but also offered different and sometimes conflicting appraisals of the clinical relevance and policy implications. More than just the timeliness and usefulness of HTA findings are at issue. The views of specialists are grounded in a clinical understanding of what counts as evidence and how decisions should be made, a view that contrasts with the societal perspective of HTA. CONCLUSIONS: HTA producers cannot afford to overlook medical specialists who play a key role in the adoption of health technologies. Establishing a transparent dialogue between producers and users of HTA reports could enrich policy recommendations.},

abstract = {Question: Does exercise using a gaming console result in similar cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure as formally prescribed exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis? How do these patients perceive gaming console exercise? Design: Randomised cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 19 adults with cystic fibrosis admitted to hospital for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Intervention: Participants underwent two 15-minute exercise interventions on separate days; one involving a gaming console and one a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Outcome measures: Cardiovascular demand was measured using heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Energy expenditure was estimated using a portable activity monitor. Perception (enjoyment, fatigue, workload, effectiveness, feasibility) was rated using a horizontal 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: There was no significant difference in average heart rate (mean difference 3 beats/min, 95\% Cl -3 to 9) or energy expenditure (0.1 MET, 95\% Cl -0.3 to 0.5) between the two interventions. Both interventions provided a 'hard' workout (RPE \~{}15). Gaming console exercise was rated as more enjoyable (mean difference 2.6 cm, 95\% CI 1.6 to 3.6) than formal exercise but they didn't differ significantly in fatigue (-1.0 cm, 95\% CI -2.4 to 0.3), perceived effectiveness (-0.4 cm, 95\% CI -1.2 to 0.3), or perceived feasibility for inclusion in routine management (0.2 cm, 95\% CI -0.7 to 1.1). Conclusion: Gaming console exercise provides a similar cardiovascular demand as traditional exercise modalities. It is feasible that adults with cystic fibrosis could include gaming console exercise in their exercise program. Trial registration: ACTRN12610000861055. ??

@article{Darbee2004a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have large amounts of infected mucus in their lungs, which causes irreversible lung tissue damage. Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Therefore, this preliminary investigation described responses in distribution of ventilation and gas mixing to PEP breathing for patients with moderate to severe CF lung disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of PEP breathing on ventilation distribution, gas mixing, lung volumes, expiratory airflow, percentage of arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), and sputum volume were studied in 5 patients with CF (mean age=18 years, SD=4, range=13-22) after no-PEP, low-PEP (10-20 cm H(2)O), and high-PEP (>20 cm H(2)O) breathing conditions. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. Single-breath tests assess ventilation distribution homogeneity and gas mixing by observing the extent to which an inspired test gas mixes with gas already residing in the lung. RESULTS: Improvements in gas mixing were observed in all PEP conditions. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5\%, the low-PEP group improved by 15\%, and the high-PEP group improved by 23\%. Slow vital capacity increased by 1\% for no PEP, by 9\% for low PEP, and by 13\% for high PEP 45 minutes after intervention. Residual volume decreased by 13\% after no PEP, by 20\% after low PEP, and by 30\% after high PEP. Immediate improvements in forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity maneuver (FEF(25\%-75\%)) were sustained following high PEP but not following low PEP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The results confirm that low PEP and high PEP improve gas mixing in individuals with CF, and these improvements were associated with increased lung function, sputum expectoration, and SpO(2). The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that typically produces malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections. Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage. Earlier diagnosis has prevented serious complications through early initiation of preventive therapies such as improved nutrition.},

Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6\%; moderate/large problem: 21.9\%), eating (32.4\%) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4\%). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3\%), anxiety (16.4\%) and stress (34.2\%). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95\% CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},

abstract = {REVIEW DATE: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. OBJECTIVES: Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, 'What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?'. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the 'grey literature' were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. HEADLINE RESULTS: Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback--51 (47\%) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice--43 (39\%) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration--27 (25\%) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level--15 (14\%) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies--11 (10\%) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation--11 (10\%) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment--10 (9\%) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning--10 (9\%) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes--seven (6\%) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity--four (3\%) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. CONCLUSIONS: While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as "game only" or "control" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each > 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P ≤ .1, significance at P < .05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26\%) and control periods (32\%). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = .07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = .71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV(1), though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV(1) from baseline (r = 0.50, P = .09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6\% ± 24.0\% and 66.5\% ± 31.2\%, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6\% and 79.1\%, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7\% vs. 78.4\%, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50\% of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between observations of the quality of family relationships and problem-solving skills and reported adherence to medical treatments for older children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

@article{Flume2009a,
abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by dehydration of airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, there is difficulty clearing pathogens from the lung, and patients experience chronic pulmonary infections and inflammation. Clearance of airway secretions has been a primary therapy for those with CF, and a variety of airway clearance therapies (ACTs) have been developed. Because ACTs are intrusive and require considerable time and effort, it is important that appropriate techniques are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. Therefore, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for each therapy and provide guidance for their use. A systematic review was commissioned, which identified 7 unique reviews and 13 additional controlled trials that addressed one or more of the comparisons of interest and were deemed eligible for inclusion. Recommendations for use of the ACTs were made, balancing the quality of evidence and the potential harms and benefits. The committee determined that, although there is a paucity of controlled trials that assess the long-term effects of ACTs, the evidence quality overall for their use in CF is fair and the benefit is moderate. The committee recommends airway clearance be performed on a regular basis in all patients. There are no ACTs demonstrated to be superior to others, so the prescription of ACTs should be individualized. Aerobic exercise is recommended as an adjunctive therapy for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health.},

abstract = {Action video game training may hold promise as a cognitive intervention with the potential to enhance daily functioning and remediate impairments, but this must be more thoroughly evaluated through evidence-based practices. We review current research on the effect of action video game training on visual attention and visuospatial processing, executive functions, and learning and memory. Focusing on studies that utilize strict experimental controls and synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological data, we examine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between action video game training and beneficial changes in cognition. Convergent lines of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence tentatively support the efficacy of training, but the magnitude and specificity of these effects remain obscure. Causal inference is thus far limited by a lack of standardized and well-controlled methodology. Considering future directions, we suggest stringent adherence to evidence-based practices and collaboration modeled after clinical trial networks. Finally, we recommend the exploration of more complex causal models, such as indirect causal relationships and interactions that may be masking true effects.},

In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer- reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user–game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user–game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis.Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.},

Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60\% of the patients and by 62\% of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},
