abstract = {The clearance of secretions from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an important component in the fight to preserve their lung function. There is excessive inflammation in the airways of these patients, which is thought to be exaggerated by ineffective mucociliary clearance and bacterial infection. In 2005 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed the Pulmonary Therapies Committee to review all of the medical literature on the various airway-clearance therapies used in treating CF lung disease. The recommendations were: an airway-clearance therapy should be performed by all patients with CF, no form of airway-clearance therapy stood out as being superior to another, and that patients may express a preference of one therapy over another. They also concluded that aerobic exercise is beneficial to patients with CF, as it is to everyone, and that exercise should be a component to the overall health routine of patients with CF. The challenge for respiratory and physical therapists together with the patient/family is to develop a plan of attack through the use of various airway-clearance therapies. The respiratory and physical therapists are integral in helping patients and families develop airway-clearance routines that aid in the removal of the secretions that cause airway obstruction. There is a wide range of airway-clearance therapies that therapists can choose from when they are teaching the patients and family members the strategies of secretion removal. The questions are: What therapy is best for what age or stage of lung disease? What therapies will the patient do? And which therapies will be covered by medical insurance? These are all fundamental questions that must be answered when guiding families in finding therapies that are effective and appropriate for each CF patient's unique situation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have large amounts of infected mucus in their lungs, which causes irreversible lung tissue damage. Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Therefore, this preliminary investigation described responses in distribution of ventilation and gas mixing to PEP breathing for patients with moderate to severe CF lung disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of PEP breathing on ventilation distribution, gas mixing, lung volumes, expiratory airflow, percentage of arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), and sputum volume were studied in 5 patients with CF (mean age=18 years, SD=4, range=13-22) after no-PEP, low-PEP (10-20 cm H(2)O), and high-PEP (>20 cm H(2)O) breathing conditions. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. Single-breath tests assess ventilation distribution homogeneity and gas mixing by observing the extent to which an inspired test gas mixes with gas already residing in the lung. RESULTS: Improvements in gas mixing were observed in all PEP conditions. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5{\%}, the low-PEP group improved by 15{\%}, and the high-PEP group improved by 23{\%}. Slow vital capacity increased by 1{\%} for no PEP, by 9{\%} for low PEP, and by 13{\%} for high PEP 45 minutes after intervention. Residual volume decreased by 13{\%} after no PEP, by 20{\%} after low PEP, and by 30{\%} after high PEP. Immediate improvements in forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity maneuver (FEF(25{\%}-75{\%})) were sustained following high PEP but not following low PEP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The results confirm that low PEP and high PEP improve gas mixing in individuals with CF, and these improvements were associated with increased lung function, sputum expectoration, and SpO(2). The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.},

In addition to device evaluations and original clinical research, the expert opinion, systematic reviews, and evidence-based practice guidelines can be found. These tools can be used to develop protocols and pathways to guide our practice.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between observations of the quality of family relationships and problem-solving skills and reported adherence to medical treatments for older children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment adherence is crucial in patients with cystic fibrosis, but poor adherence is a problem, especially during adolescence. Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60{\%} of the patients and by 62{\%} of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6{\%} ± 24.0{\%} and 66.5{\%} ± 31.2{\%}, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6{\%} and 79.1{\%}, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7{\%} vs. 78.4{\%}, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage.

Although the value of regular airway clearance treatments has been shown in many studies, adherence to the prescribed treatments is not very good (see Making airway clearance successful, pp. 000-000). In the past the only method available was conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT; also known as manual percussion and postural drainage). CCPT remains the 'gold standard' of airway clearance methods and may be the best choice for some patients, such as infants and young children. However, the many newer methods of airway clearance available now allow CF patients and their families to choose the techniques and devices that best suits them. Most of the newer airway clearance devices have been studied in comparison to standard chest physiotherapy and most studies show no advantage of one method over another. This review will describe newer airway clearance devices available for CF patients and discuss evidence for the effectiveness of these devices compared to standard chest physiotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to examine the safety and efficacy of airway clearance devices (ACDs) for cystic fibrosis and attempt to differentiate between devices, where possible, on grounds of clinical efficacy, quality of life, safety and/or patient preference. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, inherited, life-limiting disease that affects multiple systems of the human body. Respiratory dysfunction is the primary complication and leading cause of death due to CF. CF causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging, which in turn can lead to bacterial infection and further mucous production. Over time, this almost cyclical process contributes to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Removal of airway secretions, termed airway clearance, is thus an integral component of the management of CF. A variety of methods are available for airway clearance, some requiring mechanical devices, others physical manipulation of the body (e.g. physiotherapy). Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), through the assistance of a caregiver, is the current standard of care for achieving airway clearance, particularly in young patients up to the ages of six or seven. CF patients are, however, living much longer now than in decades past. The median age of survival in Canada has risen to 37.0 years for the period of 1998-2002 (5-year window), up from 22.8 years for the 5-year window ending in 1977. The prevalence has also risen accordingly, last recorded as 3,453 in Canada in 2002, up from 1,630 in 1977. With individuals living longer, there is a greater need for independent methods of airway clearance. AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CLASSES OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: positive expiratory pressure devices (PEP), airway oscillating devices (AOD; either handheld or stationary) and high frequency chest compression (HFCC)/mechanical percussion (MP) devices. Within these classes are numerous different brands of devices from various manufacturers, each with subtle iterations. At least 10 devices are licensed by Health Canada (ranging from Class 1 to Class 3 devices). EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does long-term use of ACDs improve outcomes of interest in comparison to CCPT in patients with CF?Does long-term use of one class of ACD improve outcomes of interest in comparison to another class of ACD in CF patients? LITERATURE SEARCH: A comprehensive literature search was performed on March 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing {\&} Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1950 to March 7, 2009. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials including those of parallel and crossover design,Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Abstracts were generally excluded because their methods could not be examined; however, abstract data was included in several Cochrane meta-analyses presented in this paper;Studies of less than seven days duration (including single treatment studies);Studies that did not report primary outcomes;Studies in which less than 10 patients completed the study. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Primary outcomes under review were percent-predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV-1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25{\%}-75{\%} (FEF25-75). Secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, adherence, patient preference, quality of life and adverse events. All outcomes were decided a priori. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Literature searching and back-searching identified 13 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, along with three Cochrane systematic reviews. The Cochrane reviews were identified in preliminary searching and used as the basis for formulating this review. Results were subgrouped by comparison and according to the available literature. For example, results from Cochrane meta-analyses included abstract data and therefore, additional meta-analyses were also performed on trials reported as full publications only (MAS generally excludes abstracted data when full publications are available as the methodological quality of trials reported in abstract cannot be properly assessed). Executive Summary Table 1 summarizes the results across all comparisons and subgroupings for primary outcomes of pulmonary function. Only two comparisons yielded evidence of moderate or high quality according to GRADE criteria-the comparisons of CCPT vs. PEP and handheld AOD vs. PEP-but only the comparison of CCPT vs. PEP noted a significant difference between treatment groups. In comparison to CCPT, there was a significant difference in favour of PEP for {\%} predicted FEV-1 and FVC according to one long-term, parallel RCT. This trial was accepted as the best available evidence for the comparison. The body of evidence for the remaining comparisons was low to very low, according to GRADE criteria, being downgraded most often because of poor methodological quality and low generalizability. Specifically, trials were likely not adequately powered (low sample sizes), did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses, were conducted primarily in children and young adolescents, and outdated (conducted more than 10 years ago). Secondary outcomes were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were generally not of value to decision-making. Of note, there were a significantly higher number of hospitalizations among participants undergoing AOD therapy in comparison to PEP therapy.

These technologies, however, are either obsolete or their clinical efficacy is not supported by evidence. ADP provided roughly {\$}16,000 in funding for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Using device costs and prevalent and incident cases of CF in Ontario, budget impact projections were generated for Ontario. Prevalence of CF in Ontario for patients from ages 6 to 71 was cited as 1,047 cases in 2002 while incidence was estimated at 46 new cases of CF diagnosed per year in 2002. Budget impact projections indicated that PEP and handheld AODs were highly economically feasible costing around {\$}90,000 for the entire prevalent population and less than {\$}3,000 per year to cover new incident cases. HFCC vest devices were by far the most expensive, costing in excess of {\$}19 million to cover the prevalent population alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of sufficiently powered, long-term, parallel randomized controlled trials investigating the use of ACDs in comparison to other airway clearance techniques. While much of the current evidence suggests no significant difference between various ACDs and alternative therapies/technologies, at least according to outcomes of pulmonary function, there is a strong possibility that past trials were not sufficiently powered to identify a difference. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing ACDs to CCPT as withholding therapy using an ACD may be seen as unethical at present. Conclusions of clinical effectiveness are as follows: Moderate quality evidence suggests that PEP is at least as effective as or more effective than CCPT, according to primary outcomes of pulmonary function.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis.Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.},

DESIGN: A clinic-based prospective intervention study. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. POPULATION: Nine children with cystic fibrosis with little or no obstructive airway disease who were selected from the outpatient Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonary Clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. METHODS: Each child received HFCC alone (at 10 Hz with chest wall pressure of 8 cm H2O) and HFCC plus PEEP. A closed circuit spirometry system was used to measure HFCC- and PEEP-induced changes in EELV, expressed as per cent baseline functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using helium dilution. An isothermic chamber permitted measurement of V(osc). RESULTS: HFCC caused a significant 9{\%} decrease in EELV. Adding 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O of PEEP increased EELV back to at least the FRC level. With HFCC alone, Vosc was significantly lower during spontaneous expiration than during spontaneous inspiration, but adding PEEP to HFCC increased V(osc), especially during spontaneous expiration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PEEP during HFCC prevents the decrease in EELV and increases V(osc). Therefore, PEEP may improve HFCC-induced mucus clearance in children with cystic fibrosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatments is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50{\%} of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {Background: Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50{\%}. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50{\%} for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27{\%} to 46{\%}. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Using one such device, we have monitored nebulised antibiotic adherence in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Methods: In CF children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, downloaded data from an AAD device was used to calculate morning, evening and overall monthly adherence to antibiotic therapy over a year. Results: Overall monthly adherence to nebulised antibiotic therapy in 28 children was maintained between 60 and 70{\%} over the year. Considerable variation in adherence, both between and within patients, was evident (Mean [SD] coefficient of variation, 37[44]{\%}). Evening adherence (75[37]{\%}) was better than morning adherence (58[34]{\%}: p = 0.012). Treatment regimens were changed in 8/28 patients based on adherence data. Conclusions: Routine adherence monitoring can be implemented in an outpatient setting. Using this type of information it is possible to identify which aspects of treatment can be improved and to work together with families to individualise treatments. ?? 2009 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Problems with sleep, eating and adherence to therapy may adversely affect health outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6{\%}; moderate/large problem: 21.9{\%}), eating (32.4{\%}) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4{\%}). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3{\%}), anxiety (16.4{\%}) and stress (34.2{\%}). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95{\%} CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},
