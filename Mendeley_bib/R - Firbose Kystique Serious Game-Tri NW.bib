abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how medical specialists view health technology assessment (HTA) and its role in policy-making. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 28 medical specialists practising in Quebec and Ontario (Canada) to examine their views on an HTA report relevant to their specialty (prostate-specific antigen screening, electroconvulsive therapy and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome). RESULTS: Medical specialists represent a particularly demanding audience for HTA producers because they are knowledgeable about current studies in their field and often contribute to the evidence base that HTA seeks to synthesize. In all three cases, specialists not only challenged specific points in the content of the HTA reports but also offered different and sometimes conflicting appraisals of the clinical relevance and policy implications. More than just the timeliness and usefulness of HTA findings are at issue. The views of specialists are grounded in a clinical understanding of what counts as evidence and how decisions should be made, a view that contrasts with the societal perspective of HTA. CONCLUSIONS: HTA producers cannot afford to overlook medical specialists who play a key role in the adoption of health technologies. Establishing a transparent dialogue between producers and users of HTA reports could enrich policy recommendations.},

abstract = {The field of rehabilitation has increasingly adopted commercially available games using perceptual interfaces as a means for physically training patients. The adaptability of such systems to match each person's need and rehabilitation goal remains problematic. This paper presents a rapid prototyping approach for customising gaming technology using various affordable commercial devices and open source software. We first demonstrate how a freely available game is adapted for training disabled people through different sensors and control modes. We then show how an open online virtual world such as Second Life ® offers sufficient conditions for quickly building custom content for testing with interactive devices. When presented with these prototyping possibilities, people from the target groups (healthcare professionals, patients, people with disabilities, older people, families) related such systems to their needs and further elaborated on the use of such systems. Our research indicates how availability of simple prototyping platforms expands upon the possibilities for developers and practitioners. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · New York.},

abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the use of specialised medical equipment by patients at home has increased in most industrialised countries. Adopting a conceptual framework that brings together two research perspectives, i.e. the sociology of technology and the sociology of illness, this paper empirically examines why and how patients use health technology at home and in the broader social world. Our study compares and contrasts the use of four interventions: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. We conducted interviews with patients (n = 16) and caregivers (n = 6), and made direct observations of home visits by nurses (n = 16). The content and structure of patient manuals distributed by major manufacturers and hospitals were analysed (n = 26). The aim of our study was to determine how technology was supposed to be used versus how it was actually used. This study shows that patients are deeply ambivalent about the benefits and drawbacks of technology, and that these advantages and disadvantages are shaped by the various places in which the technology is used. While technology can be pivotal in making patients autonomous and able to participate in the social world, it also imposes heavy restrictions that are intimately interwoven with the nature of the particular disease and with the patient's personal life trajectory.},

abstract = {Action video game training may hold promise as a cognitive intervention with the potential to enhance daily functioning and remediate impairments, but this must be more thoroughly evaluated through evidence-based practices. We review current research on the effect of action video game training on visual attention and visuospatial processing, executive functions, and learning and memory. Focusing on studies that utilize strict experimental controls and synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological data, we examine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between action video game training and beneficial changes in cognition. Convergent lines of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence tentatively support the efficacy of training, but the magnitude and specificity of these effects remain obscure. Causal inference is thus far limited by a lack of standardized and well-controlled methodology. Considering future directions, we suggest stringent adherence to evidence-based practices and collaboration modeled after clinical trial networks. Finally, we recommend the exploration of more complex causal models, such as indirect causal relationships and interactions that may be masking true effects.},

abstract = {Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to 'transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.},

abstract = {REVIEW DATE: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. OBJECTIVES: Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, 'What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?'. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the 'grey literature' were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. HEADLINE RESULTS: Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback--51 (47\%) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice--43 (39\%) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration--27 (25\%) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level--15 (14\%) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies--11 (10\%) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation--11 (10\%) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment--10 (9\%) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning--10 (9\%) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes--seven (6\%) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity--four (3\%) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. CONCLUSIONS: While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active video games (AVGs) have gained interest as a way to increase physical activity in children and youth. The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.},

This can lead to poor adherence and a reduction in health outcomes.This study examines the role of device design in the real-world effectiveness of a medical device used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis from the perspective of adolescent users. Interactive design interviews were carried out with 20 adolescent users of the acapella?? physiotherapy device to investigate user requirements and themes about the user-device relationship that are important to this user group. This study found that adolescent users of the acapella?? device do not use the device as regularly and correctly as is recommended by clinicians. A number of aspects of the current design of the acapella?? device were identified that affect how and how often it is used. Five factors are identified that may improve the real world effectiveness of the acapella?? device for adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis: engagement, information, confidence, aesthetics and compatibility with lifestyle. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

abstract = {Health game research has flourished over the last decade. The number of peer-reviewed scientific publications has surged as the clinical application of health games has diversified. In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer- reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user–game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user–game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},
