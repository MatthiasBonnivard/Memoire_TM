@article{Schroeder_DecimationTrianglesMeshes,
abstract = {Computer graphics applications routinely generate geometric models consisting of large numbers of triangles. We present an algorithm that significantly reduces the number of triangles required to model a physical or abatract object. The algorithm makes multiple passea over an existing triangle mesh, using local geometry and topology to remove vertices that pas a distance or angle criterion. The holes left by the vertex removal are patched using a local triangulation proeeas. The decimation algorithm has been implemented in a general scientific visualization system as a general network filter. Examples from volume modeling and terrain modeling illustrate the results of the decimation algorithm.},

@article{Behrendt_BillboardCloud,
abstract = {We present techniques for realistic real-time rendering of complex landscapes that consist of many highly detailed plant models. The plants are approximated by dynamically changing sets of billboards. Realistic illumination is approximated using spherical harmonics. Since even the rendering of simple billboard cloud plants is too time consuming, the landscape in the background is approximated with shell textures. The combination of these techniques allows us to render large scenes in real-time with varying illumination, which is interesting for computer games and interactive visualization in landscaping and architecture as well as modelling.},
