abstract = {We describe a novel method for surgery simulation including a$\backslash$nvolumetric model built from medical images and an elastic modeling of$\backslash$nthe deformations. The physical model is based on elasticity theory which$\backslash$nsuitably links the shape of deformable bodies and the forces associated$\backslash$nwith the deformation. A real time computation of the deformation is$\backslash$npossible thanks to a preprocessing of elementary deformations derived$\backslash$nfrom a finite element method. This method has been implemented in a$\backslash$nsystem including a force feedback device and a collision detection$\backslash$nalgorithm. The simulator works in real time with a high resolution liver$\backslash$nmodel},
annote = {{\&}quot;When adding force feeback in a simulation, the main difficulty is realted to the real-time constraint imposed by such a system: to remain realistic, the forces must be computed at a very high frequency, at least equeal to 300 Hz [Bur96]. This frequency can vary according to the tissue stiffness and the kind of interaction. Deformations and graphics rendering neeed to be performed at about 24 Hz, that corresponds to the frequency of the human parsistence of vision.{\&}quot;},

@article{Bingham2012e,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as "game only" or "control" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each > 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P ≤ .1, significance at P < .05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26{\%}) and control periods (32{\%}). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = .07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = .71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV(1), though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV(1) from baseline (r = 0.50, P = .09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned.},

abstract = {EEG studies examining 'resting' state (i.e. non-task) state brain activity in major depressive disorder (MDD) have reported numerous abnormalities within the alpha bandwidth. These findings are discussed extensively within affective disorders literature but their relationship to functional aspects of depressive psychopathology remains unclear. Investigating alpha modulation during active cognitive processing may provide a more targeted means of relating aberrant alpha activity to specific aspects of depression symptomatology. Alpha activity is reliably modulated during working memory (WM) processing and WM impairments are a common neuropsychological consequence of MDD. Moreover, it has been suggested that alpha activity reflects internally mediated inhibitory process and attenuated inhibition has been suggested to contribute to WM inefficacy.},

abstract = {Stroke is a frequent cause of adult disability that can lead to enduring impairments. However, given the life-long plasticity of the brain one could assume that recovery could be facilitated by the harnessing of mechanisms underlying neuronal reorganization. Currently it is not clear how this reorganization can be mobilized. Novel technology based neurorehabilitation techniques hold promise to address this issue. Here we describe a Virtual Reality (VR) based system, the Rehabilitation Gaming System (RGS) that is based on a number of hypotheses on the neuronal mechanisms underlying recovery, the structure of training and the role of individualization. We investigate the psychometrics of the RGS in stroke patients and healthy controls.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have large amounts of infected mucus in their lungs, which causes irreversible lung tissue damage. Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Therefore, this preliminary investigation described responses in distribution of ventilation and gas mixing to PEP breathing for patients with moderate to severe CF lung disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of PEP breathing on ventilation distribution, gas mixing, lung volumes, expiratory airflow, percentage of arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), and sputum volume were studied in 5 patients with CF (mean age=18 years, SD=4, range=13-22) after no-PEP, low-PEP (10-20 cm H(2)O), and high-PEP (>20 cm H(2)O) breathing conditions. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. Single-breath tests assess ventilation distribution homogeneity and gas mixing by observing the extent to which an inspired test gas mixes with gas already residing in the lung. RESULTS: Improvements in gas mixing were observed in all PEP conditions. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5{\%}, the low-PEP group improved by 15{\%}, and the high-PEP group improved by 23{\%}. Slow vital capacity increased by 1{\%} for no PEP, by 9{\%} for low PEP, and by 13{\%} for high PEP 45 minutes after intervention. Residual volume decreased by 13{\%} after no PEP, by 20{\%} after low PEP, and by 30{\%} after high PEP. Immediate improvements in forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity maneuver (FEF(25{\%}-75{\%})) were sustained following high PEP but not following low PEP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The results confirm that low PEP and high PEP improve gas mixing in individuals with CF, and these improvements were associated with increased lung function, sputum expectoration, and SpO(2). The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.},

abstract = {A two variable model with delay in both the variables, is proposed for the circadian oscillations of protein concentrations in the fungal species Neurospora crassa. The dynamical variables chosen are the concentrations of FRQ and WC-1 proteins. Our model is a two variable simplification of the detailed model of Smolen et al. (J. Neurosci. 21 (2001) 6644) modeling circadian oscillations with interlocking positive and negative feedback loops, containing 23 variables. In our model, as in the case of Smolen's model, a sustained limit cycle oscillation takes place in both FRQ and WC-1 protein in continuous darkness, and WC-1 is anti-phase to FRQ protein, as observed in experiments. The model accounts for various characteristic features of circadian rhythms such as entrainment to light dark cycles, phase response curves and robustness to parameter variation and molecular fluctuations. Simulations are carried out to study the effect of periodic forcing of circadian oscillations by lightdark cycles. The periodic forcing resulted in a rich bifurcation diagram that includes quasiperiodicity and chaotic oscillations, depending on the magnitude of the periodic changes in the light controlled parameter. When positive feedback is eliminated, our model reduces to the generic one dimensional delay model of Lema et al. (J. Theor. Biol. 204 (2000) 565), delay model of the circadian pace maker with FRQ protein as the dynamical variable which represses its own production. This one-dimensional model also exhibits all characteristic features of circadian oscillations and gives rise to circadian oscillations which are reasonably robust to parameter variations and molecular noise.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that typically produces malnutrition and chronic respiratory infections. Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage. Earlier diagnosis has prevented serious complications through early initiation of preventive therapies such as improved nutrition.},

abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The partial paralysis that stroke patients often experience can make independent living difficult or impossible. Research suggests that many of these patients could recover by performing hundreds of daily repetitions of motions with their affected limbs. Yet, only 31{\%} of patients perform the exercises recommended by their therapists. Home-based stroke rehabilitation games may help motivate stroke patients to perform the necessary exercises to recover. In this paper, we describe a formative study in which we designed and user tested stroke rehabilitation games with both stroke patients and therapists. We describe the lessons we learned about what makes games useful from a therapeutic point of view.},

abstract = {In two experiments we investigated the effects of voluntary movements on temporal haptic perception. Measures of sensitivity (JND) and temporal alignment (PSS) were obtained from temporal order judgments made on intermodal auditory-haptic (Experiment 1) or intramodal haptic (Experiment 2) stimulus pairs under three movement conditions. In the baseline, static condition, the arm of the participants remained stationary. In the passive condition, the arm was displaced by a servo-controlled motorized device. In the active condition, the participants moved voluntarily. The auditory stimulus was a short, 500 Hz tone presented over headphones and the haptic stimulus was a brief suprathreshold force pulse applied to the tip of the index finger orthogonally to the finger movement. Active movement did not significantly affect discrimination sensitivity on the auditory-haptic stimulus pairs, whereas it significantly improved sensitivity in the case of the haptic stimulus pair, demonstrating a key role for motor command information in temporal sensitivity in the haptic system. Points of subjective simultaneity were by-and-large coincident with physical simultaneity, with one striking exception in the passive condition with the auditory-haptic stimulus pair. In the latter case, the haptic stimulus had to be presented 45 ms before the auditory stimulus in order to obtain subjective simultaneity. A model is proposed to explain the discrimination performance.},

@article{MeriansSensorimotorTraining,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients' and the clinicians' time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.},

This can lead to poor adherence and a reduction in health outcomes.This study examines the role of device design in the real-world effectiveness of a medical device used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis from the perspective of adolescent users. Interactive design interviews were carried out with 20 adolescent users of the acapella?? physiotherapy device to investigate user requirements and themes about the user-device relationship that are important to this user group. This study found that adolescent users of the acapella?? device do not use the device as regularly and correctly as is recommended by clinicians. A number of aspects of the current design of the acapella?? device were identified that affect how and how often it is used. Five factors are identified that may improve the real world effectiveness of the acapella?? device for adolescents with Cystic Fibrosis: engagement, information, confidence, aesthetics and compatibility with lifestyle. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.},

abstract = {After stroke, enduring rehabilitation is required for maximum recovery, and ideally throughout life to prevent functional deterioration. Hence we developed a new concept for at-home low-cost motor rehabilitation, the NTT, an Internet-based interactive system for upper-limb rehabilitation. In this paper we present the NTT design concepts, its implementation and a proof of concept study with 10 healthy participants. The NTT brings together concepts of optimal learning, engagement, and storytelling to deliver a personalized training to its users. In this study we evaluate the feasibility of NTT as a tool capable of automatically assessing and adapting to its user. This is achieved by means of a psychometric study where we show that the NTT is able to assess movement kinematics-movement smoothness, range of motion, arm displacement and arm coordination-in healthy users. Subsequently, a modeling approach is presented to understand how the measured movement kinematics relate to training parameters, and how these can be modified to adapt the training to meet the needs of patients. Finally, an adaptive algorithm for the personalization of training considering motivational and performance aspects is proposed. In the next phase we will deploy and evaluate the NTT with stroke patients at their homes.},

@article{Elkins2006d,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis.Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.},

abstract = {REVIEW DATE: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. OBJECTIVES: Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, 'What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?'. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the 'grey literature' were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. HEADLINE RESULTS: Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback--51 (47{\%}) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice--43 (39{\%}) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration--27 (25{\%}) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level--15 (14{\%}) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies--11 (10{\%}) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation--11 (10{\%}) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment--10 (9{\%}) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning--10 (9{\%}) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes--seven (6{\%}) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity--four (3{\%}) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. CONCLUSIONS: While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.},

As with other segments of the population, it has been difficult to devise exercise programs to which most patients will adhere for long periods of time. In healthy children, factors that are related to positive exercise compliance include social support, perceptions of competency and self-esteem, enjoyment of activity, and availability of a variety of activities. In patients with CF, complications associated with the disease, e.g., time required for other treatment and fatigue, make compliance with recommended exercise activities more difficult. Factors likely to increase compliance in this population include explicit and continued encouragement and support from the family and healthcare team, and the introduction of behavior-changing strategies.},

abstract = {Question: Does exercise using a gaming console result in similar cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure as formally prescribed exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis? How do these patients perceive gaming console exercise? Design: Randomised cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 19 adults with cystic fibrosis admitted to hospital for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Intervention: Participants underwent two 15-minute exercise interventions on separate days; one involving a gaming console and one a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Outcome measures: Cardiovascular demand was measured using heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Energy expenditure was estimated using a portable activity monitor. Perception (enjoyment, fatigue, workload, effectiveness, feasibility) was rated using a horizontal 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: There was no significant difference in average heart rate (mean difference 3 beats/min, 95{\%} Cl -3 to 9) or energy expenditure (0.1 MET, 95{\%} Cl -0.3 to 0.5) between the two interventions. Both interventions provided a 'hard' workout (RPE {\~{}}15). Gaming console exercise was rated as more enjoyable (mean difference 2.6 cm, 95{\%} CI 1.6 to 3.6) than formal exercise but they didn't differ significantly in fatigue (-1.0 cm, 95{\%} CI -2.4 to 0.3), perceived effectiveness (-0.4 cm, 95{\%} CI -1.2 to 0.3), or perceived feasibility for inclusion in routine management (0.2 cm, 95{\%} CI -0.7 to 1.1). Conclusion: Gaming console exercise provides a similar cardiovascular demand as traditional exercise modalities. It is feasible that adults with cystic fibrosis could include gaming console exercise in their exercise program. Trial registration: ACTRN12610000861055. ??

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6{\%} ± 24.0{\%} and 66.5{\%} ± 31.2{\%}, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6{\%} and 79.1{\%}, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7{\%} vs. 78.4{\%}, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

abstract = {Action video game training may hold promise as a cognitive intervention with the potential to enhance daily functioning and remediate impairments, but this must be more thoroughly evaluated through evidence-based practices. We review current research on the effect of action video game training on visual attention and visuospatial processing, executive functions, and learning and memory. Focusing on studies that utilize strict experimental controls and synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological data, we examine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between action video game training and beneficial changes in cognition. Convergent lines of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence tentatively support the efficacy of training, but the magnitude and specificity of these effects remain obscure. Causal inference is thus far limited by a lack of standardized and well-controlled methodology. Considering future directions, we suggest stringent adherence to evidence-based practices and collaboration modeled after clinical trial networks. Finally, we recommend the exploration of more complex causal models, such as indirect causal relationships and interactions that may be masking true effects.},

@article{Flume2009g,
abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by dehydration of airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, there is difficulty clearing pathogens from the lung, and patients experience chronic pulmonary infections and inflammation. Clearance of airway secretions has been a primary therapy for those with CF, and a variety of airway clearance therapies (ACTs) have been developed. Because ACTs are intrusive and require considerable time and effort, it is important that appropriate techniques are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. Therefore, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for each therapy and provide guidance for their use. A systematic review was commissioned, which identified 7 unique reviews and 13 additional controlled trials that addressed one or more of the comparisons of interest and were deemed eligible for inclusion. Recommendations for use of the ACTs were made, balancing the quality of evidence and the potential harms and benefits. The committee determined that, although there is a paucity of controlled trials that assess the long-term effects of ACTs, the evidence quality overall for their use in CF is fair and the benefit is moderate. The committee recommends airway clearance be performed on a regular basis in all patients. There are no ACTs demonstrated to be superior to others, so the prescription of ACTs should be individualized. Aerobic exercise is recommended as an adjunctive therapy for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health.},

@article{Nagle_PlayerCenteredRewardScheduling,
abstract = {Among the methods used to increase enjoyment and performance in serious games, reward schedules, i.e., determining when in-game rewards should be given, have not been sufficiently explored. In the present study, we designed a simple memory training serious game and compared two methods of scheduling rewards, both based on the paradigm of positive reinforcement: fixed ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after a fixed number of correct responses, and variable ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after an unpredictable number of correct responses. To account for the variability in player preference for rewards, a player-centered sub-mode was included in both schedules by adjusting the schedule ratio according to player preference for rewards. The effectiveness of this approach was tested by comparing it against two more sub-modes: one which used a predetermined ratio, and another which set the ratio to the opposite of player preference. The game was put online and tested with 210 participants. Enjoyment, performance, duration of gameplay, and likelihood to play again were significantly higher in the player-centered sub-mode than the other sub-modes. On average, the variable-ratio schedule was better in the outcome measures than the fixed-ratio schedule. The results highlight the importance of in-game rewards, and indicate that giving rewards according to a player-centered variable-ratio schedule has the potential to make serious games more effective.},

abstract = {In psychotherapy research, fidelity instruments were originally developed as manipulation checks in experimental tests of treatment efficacy. The purposes of fidelity measurement are expanding as consumers, administrators, and payers seek to determine the extent to which the interventions purchased are actually received. Emerging purposes for fidelity measurement are described, as are challenges to developing a single instrument that can adequately meet multiple purposes, and that is both effective (psychometrically sound) and efficient (feasibly used in routine care). Examples are provided of efforts to balance these attributes of fidelity measurement, to measure fidelity at multiple levels of the practice context, and to index and evaluate the effects of additional program parameters on client outcomes in routine care.},

abstract = {The majority of neuropsychological tests used to evaluate attention processes in children lack ecological validity. The AULA Nesplora (AULA) is a continuous performance test, developed in a virtual setting, very similar to a school classroom. The aim of the present study is to analyze the convergent validity between the AULA and the Continuous Performance Test (CPT) of Conners. The AULA and CPT were administered correlatively to 57 children, aged 6-16 years (26.3{\%} female) with average cognitive ability (IQ mean = 100.56, SD = 10.38) who had a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) according to DSM-IV-TR criteria. Spearman correlations analyses were conducted among the different variables. Significant correlations were observed between both tests in all the analyzed variables (omissions, commissions, reaction time, and variability of reaction time), including for those measures of the AULA based on different sensorial modalities, presentation of distractors, and task paradigms. Hence, convergent validity between both tests was confirmed. Moreover, the AULA showed differences by gender and correlation to Perceptual Reasoning and Working Memory indexes of the WISC-IV, supporting the relevance of IQ measures in the understanding of cognitive performance in ADHD. In addition, the AULA (but not Conners' CPT) was able to differentiate between ADHD children with and without pharmacological treatment for a wide range of measures related to inattention, impulsivity, processing speed, motor activity, and quality of attention focus. Additional measures and advantages of the AULA versus Conners' CPT are discussed.},

The plants are approximated by dynamically changing sets of billboards. Realistic illumination is approximated using spherical harmonics. Since even the rendering of simple billboard cloud plants is too time consuming, the landscape in the background is approximated with shell textures. The combination of these techniques allows us to render large scenes in real-time with varying illumination, which is interesting for computer games and interactive visualization in landscaping and architecture as well as modelling.},

abstract = {An index known as leachate pollution index (LPI) for quantifying the leachate contamination potential of municipal landfills had been developed and reported by the authors. It is a quantitative tool by which the leachate pollution data of landfill sites can be reported uniformly. LPI is an increasing scale index and has been formulated based on the Delphi technique. It provides a convenient means of summarizing complex leachate pollution data and facilitates its communication to the general public, field professionals and policy makers. However, it is observed that the LPI, like any other environmental index, fails to effectively communicate the details about the strength of various pollutants/pollutant groups present. In an effort to make the LPI more informative and useful, it is proposed to divide the LPI into three sub-indices. The aggregation of these three sub-LPIs will result in the overall LPI. The formulation and the application of LPI and its three sub-indices are presented in this paper. It has been concluded that the splitting of LPI into three sub-indices provides a better insight on the strength of various pollutants and can be useful to the experts in deciding various management issues regarding leachate treatment. The leachate characteristics of a UK landfill have been used as a case study to demonstrate the calculation of three sub-LPIs and the overall LPI.},

The system was tested on a chronic stroke subject, under local and tele-rehabilitation conditions, over 5 weeks of training. Results show improvements in arm motor control and shoulder range of motion, corresponding to improved Fugl-Meyer test scores. Exercise duration, level of difficulty, and patient motivation were maintained under tele-rehabilitaion. A 1-week retention trial showed that gains were maintained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Active video games (AVGs) have gained interest as a way to increase physical activity in children and youth. The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.},

abstract = {Information technologies are increasingly helping to integrate and socially include people with visual disabilities. Computing technologies have contributed grandly to attain this goal through innovative techniques and applications. Virtual environments, I/O interfaces, and sound based applications altogether with usability and cognitive impact studies are some of the most used research designs for children with visual disabilities. This study presents the design and usability evaluation of three-dimensional (3D) interactive environments for children with visual disabilities. We introduce AudioChile and AudioVida, interactive virtual environments that can be navigated through 3D sound to enhance spatiality and immersion throughout the environments 3D sound is used to orientate, to avoid obstacles, and to identify the position of diverse personages and objects within the environment. Usability evaluation results indicated that sound can be fundamental for attention and motivation purposes during interaction.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between observations of the quality of family relationships and problem-solving skills and reported adherence to medical treatments for older children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

abstract = {Locomotion generates multisensory information about walked-upon objects. How perceptual systems use such information to get to know the environment remains unexplored. The ability to identify solid (e.g., marble) and aggregate (e.g., gravel) walked-upon materials was investigated in auditory, haptic or audio-haptic conditions, and in a kinesthetic condition where tactile information was perturbed with a vibromechanical noise. Overall, identification performance was better than chance in all experimental conditions and for both solids and the better identified aggregates. Despite large mechanical differences between the response of solids and aggregates to locomotion, for both material categories discrimination was at its worst in the auditory and kinesthetic conditions and at its best in the haptic and audio-haptic conditions. An analysis of the dominance of sensory information in the audio-haptic context supported a focus on the most accurate modality, haptics, but only for the identification of solid materials. When identifying aggregates, response biases appeared to produce a focus on the least accurate modality— kinesthesia. When walking on loose materials such as gravel, individuals do not perceive surfaces by focusing on the most accurate modality, but by focusing on the modality that would most promptly signal postural instabilities.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease characterized by an abnormal ventilation response that limiting the exercise tolerance. Current evidence shows that physical training increases exercise capacity, decreases disnea and improves quality of life in patients with CF. Adherence to respiratory rehabilitation programs is a key factor to guarantee optimal benefits. Our goal was to determine the efficiency of three Nintendo Wii video game as training systems by measuring the physiologic response of performing different exercises with CF patients. Method: we included 24CF patients [mean+SD: age: 12+3.7 years; BMI: 18+3; FVC: 97+20{\%}; FEV1:93+20{\%}] followed 4 different exercise types in randomized order during six minutes: (1) 6-min walking test (6MWT); (2) Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii-Fit); (3) Nintendo Wii Active (Wii-Acti), and (4) Nintendo Wii Family Trainner (Wii-Train). All physiologic responses were recorded breath by breath by using a portable gas analyzer (Fitmate Pro, Cosmed, Italy). Results: In all video game exercises, after the 3th minute, all physiological variables describe a plateau profile that remains stable until the end of the test, similar to the 6MWT. The Wii-Acti and Wii-Train obtained high and significative values compared with the 6MWT. Conclusion: From a physiological perspective, exercises executed with video game platforms are feasible and allow high intensity time-sustained exercise. This type of training could be recommended to the patients CF and can induce important physiologic improvements when used as a training method.},

abstract = {Computer graphics applications routinely generate geometric models consisting of large numbers of triangles. We present an algorithm that significantly reduces the number of triangles required to model a physical or abatract object. The algorithm makes multiple passea over an existing triangle mesh, using local geometry and topology to remove vertices that pas a distance or angle criterion.

abstract = {The clearance of secretions from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an important component in the fight to preserve their lung function. There is excessive inflammation in the airways of these patients, which is thought to be exaggerated by ineffective mucociliary clearance and bacterial infection. In 2005 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed the Pulmonary Therapies Committee to review all of the medical literature on the various airway-clearance therapies used in treating CF lung disease. The recommendations were: an airway-clearance therapy should be performed by all patients with CF, no form of airway-clearance therapy stood out as being superior to another, and that patients may express a preference of one therapy over another. They also concluded that aerobic exercise is beneficial to patients with CF, as it is to everyone, and that exercise should be a component to the overall health routine of patients with CF. The challenge for respiratory and physical therapists together with the patient/family is to develop a plan of attack through the use of various airway-clearance therapies. The respiratory and physical therapists are integral in helping patients and families develop airway-clearance routines that aid in the removal of the secretions that cause airway obstruction. There is a wide range of airway-clearance therapies that therapists can choose from when they are teaching the patients and family members the strategies of secretion removal. The questions are: What therapy is best for what age or stage of lung disease? What therapies will the patient do? And which therapies will be covered by medical insurance? These are all fundamental questions that must be answered when guiding families in finding therapies that are effective and appropriate for each CF patient's unique situation.},

Although challenges to performing clinical studies evaluating the effectiveness of airway clearance therapeutic modalities exist, resources are available in the literature. In addition to device evaluations and original clinical research, the expert opinion, systematic reviews, and evidence-based practice guidelines can be found. These tools can be used to develop protocols and pathways to guide our practice.

This report found that racial and ethnic disparities exist in health care and that a lack of access to care does not fully explain why such disparities exist. The IOM study found bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and clinical uncertainty as possible contributing causes. The U.S. Surgeon General's Report on the Oral Health of the Nation also pointed to oral health disparities related to race, ethnicity, and culture. This paper discusses how medicine is responding to the Unequal Treatment report and the lessons to be considered for dentistry. Recommendations on how dentistry can apply the knowledge from this report to help reduce oral health disparities are suggested.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and mean oscillated volume (V(osc)) during high frequency chest compression (HFCC). DESIGN: A clinic-based prospective intervention study. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. POPULATION: Nine children with cystic fibrosis with little or no obstructive airway disease who were selected from the outpatient Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonary Clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. METHODS: Each child received HFCC alone (at 10 Hz with chest wall pressure of 8 cm H2O) and HFCC plus PEEP. A closed circuit spirometry system was used to measure HFCC- and PEEP-induced changes in EELV, expressed as per cent baseline functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using helium dilution. An isothermic chamber permitted measurement of V(osc). RESULTS: HFCC caused a significant 9{\%} decrease in EELV. Adding 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O of PEEP increased EELV back to at least the FRC level. With HFCC alone, Vosc was significantly lower during spontaneous expiration than during spontaneous inspiration, but adding PEEP to HFCC increased V(osc), especially during spontaneous expiration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PEEP during HFCC prevents the decrease in EELV and increases V(osc). Therefore, PEEP may improve HFCC-induced mucus clearance in children with cystic fibrosis.},

abstract = {The field of rehabilitation has increasingly adopted commercially available games using perceptual interfaces as a means for physically training patients. The adaptability of such systems to match each person's need and rehabilitation goal remains problematic. This paper presents a rapid prototyping approach for customising gaming technology using various affordable commercial devices and open source software. We first demonstrate how a freely available game is adapted for training disabled people through different sensors and control modes. We then show how an open online virtual world such as Second Life ® offers sufficient conditions for quickly building custom content for testing with interactive devices. When presented with these prototyping possibilities, people from the target groups (healthcare professionals, patients, people with disabilities, older people, families) related such systems to their needs and further elaborated on the use of such systems. Our research indicates how availability of simple prototyping platforms expands upon the possibilities for developers and practitioners. © 2011 by Walter de Gruyter · Berlin · New York.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to examine the safety and efficacy of airway clearance devices (ACDs) for cystic fibrosis and attempt to differentiate between devices, where possible, on grounds of clinical efficacy, quality of life, safety and/or patient preference. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, inherited, life-limiting disease that affects multiple systems of the human body. Respiratory dysfunction is the primary complication and leading cause of death due to CF. CF causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging, which in turn can lead to bacterial infection and further mucous production. Over time, this almost cyclical process contributes to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Removal of airway secretions, termed airway clearance, is thus an integral component of the management of CF. A variety of methods are available for airway clearance, some requiring mechanical devices, others physical manipulation of the body (e.g. physiotherapy). Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), through the assistance of a caregiver, is the current standard of care for achieving airway clearance, particularly in young patients up to the ages of six or seven. CF patients are, however, living much longer now than in decades past. The median age of survival in Canada has risen to 37.0 years for the period of 1998-2002 (5-year window), up from 22.8 years for the 5-year window ending in 1977. The prevalence has also risen accordingly, last recorded as 3,453 in Canada in 2002, up from 1,630 in 1977. With individuals living longer, there is a greater need for independent methods of airway clearance. AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CLASSES OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: positive expiratory pressure devices (PEP), airway oscillating devices (AOD; either handheld or stationary) and high frequency chest compression (HFCC)/mechanical percussion (MP) devices. Within these classes are numerous different brands of devices from various manufacturers, each with subtle iterations. At least 10 devices are licensed by Health Canada (ranging from Class 1 to Class 3 devices). EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does long-term use of ACDs improve outcomes of interest in comparison to CCPT in patients with CF?Does long-term use of one class of ACD improve outcomes of interest in comparison to another class of ACD in CF patients? LITERATURE SEARCH: A comprehensive literature search was performed on March 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing {\&} Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1950 to March 7, 2009. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials including those of parallel and crossover design,Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Abstracts were generally excluded because their methods could not be examined; however, abstract data was included in several Cochrane meta-analyses presented in this paper;Studies of less than seven days duration (including single treatment studies);Studies that did not report primary outcomes;Studies in which less than 10 patients completed the study. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Primary outcomes under review were percent-predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV-1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25{\%}-75{\%} (FEF25-75). Secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, adherence, patient preference, quality of life and adverse events. All outcomes were decided a priori. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Literature searching and back-searching identified 13 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, along with three Cochrane systematic reviews. The Cochrane reviews were identified in preliminary searching and used as the basis for formulating this review. Results were subgrouped by comparison and according to the available literature. For example, results from Cochrane meta-analyses included abstract data and therefore, additional meta-analyses were also performed on trials reported as full publications only (MAS generally excludes abstracted data when full publications are available as the methodological quality of trials reported in abstract cannot be properly assessed). Executive Summary Table 1 summarizes the results across all comparisons and subgroupings for primary outcomes of pulmonary function. Only two comparisons yielded evidence of moderate or high quality according to GRADE criteria-the comparisons of CCPT vs. PEP and handheld AOD vs. PEP-but only the comparison of CCPT vs. PEP noted a significant difference between treatment groups. In comparison to CCPT, there was a significant difference in favour of PEP for {\%} predicted FEV-1 and FVC according to one long-term, parallel RCT. This trial was accepted as the best available evidence for the comparison. The body of evidence for the remaining comparisons was low to very low, according to GRADE criteria, being downgraded most often because of poor methodological quality and low generalizability. Specifically, trials were likely not adequately powered (low sample sizes), did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses, were conducted primarily in children and young adolescents, and outdated (conducted more than 10 years ago). Secondary outcomes were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were generally not of value to decision-making. Of note, there were a significantly higher number of hospitalizations among participants undergoing AOD therapy in comparison to PEP therapy.

Although the majority of device costs are paid out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their parents, or covered by third-party medical insurance, Ontario did provide funding assistance through the Assistive Devices Program (ADP) for postural drainage boards and MP devices. These technologies, however, are either obsolete or their clinical efficacy is not supported by evidence. ADP provided roughly {\$}16,000 in funding for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Using device costs and prevalent and incident cases of CF in Ontario, budget impact projections were generated for Ontario. Prevalence of CF in Ontario for patients from ages 6 to 71 was cited as 1,047 cases in 2002 while incidence was estimated at 46 new cases of CF diagnosed per year in 2002. Budget impact projections indicated that PEP and handheld AODs were highly economically feasible costing around {\$}90,000 for the entire prevalent population and less than {\$}3,000 per year to cover new incident cases. HFCC vest devices were by far the most expensive, costing in excess of {\$}19 million to cover the prevalent population alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of sufficiently powered, long-term, parallel randomized controlled trials investigating the use of ACDs in comparison to other airway clearance techniques. While much of the current evidence suggests no significant difference between various ACDs and alternative therapies/technologies, at least according to outcomes of pulmonary function, there is a strong possibility that past trials were not sufficiently powered to identify a difference. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing ACDs to CCPT as withholding therapy using an ACD may be seen as unethical at present. Conclusions of clinical effectiveness are as follows: Moderate quality evidence suggests that PEP is at least as effective as or more effective than CCPT, according to primary outcomes of pulmonary function.

@article{Nagle_PlayerCenteredRewardScheduling,
abstract = {Among the methods used to increase enjoyment and performance in serious games, reward schedules, i.e., determining when in-game rewards should be given, have not been sufficiently explored. In the present study, we designed a simple memory training serious game and compared two methods of scheduling rewards, both based on the paradigm of positive reinforcement: fixed ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after a fixed number of correct responses, and variable ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after an unpredictable number of correct responses. To account for the variability in player preference for rewards, a player-centered sub-mode was included in both schedules by adjusting the schedule ratio according to player preference for rewards. The effectiveness of this approach was tested by comparing it against two more sub-modes: one which used a predetermined ratio, and another which set the ratio to the opposite of player preference. The game was put online and tested with 210 participants. Enjoyment, performance, duration of gameplay, and likelihood to play again were significantly higher in the player-centered sub-mode than the other sub-modes. On average, the variable-ratio schedule was better in the outcome measures than the fixed-ratio schedule. The results highlight the importance of in-game rewards, and indicate that giving rewards according to a player-centered variable-ratio schedule has the potential to make serious games more effective.},

@article{Salen_RulesOfPlay,
abstract = {As pop culture, games are as important as film or television--but game design has yet to develop a theoretical framework or critical vocabulary. In Rules of Play Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman present a much-needed primer for this emerging field. They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games..Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like "play," "design," and "interactivity." They look at games through a series of eighteen "game design schemas," or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.},

@article{Kharrazi2012c,
abstract = {Health game research has flourished over the last decade. The number of peer-reviewed scientific publications has surged as the clinical application of health games has diversified. In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer- reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user–game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user–game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

@article{VanderLee_ForcedUse,
abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Of all stroke survivors, 30{\%} to 66{\%} are unable to use their affected arm in performing activities of daily living. Although forced use therapy appears to improve arm function in chronic stroke patients, there is no conclusive evidence. This study evaluates the effectiveness of forced use therapy. METHODS: In an observer-blinded randomized clinical trial, 66 chronic stroke patients were allocated to either forced use therapy (immobilization of the unaffected arm combined with intensive training) or a reference therapy of equally intensive bimanual training, based on Neuro-Developmental Treatment, for a period of 2 weeks. Outcomes were evaluated on the basis of the Rehabilitation Activities Profile (activities), the Action Research Arm (ARA) test (dexterity), the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale, the Motor Activity Log (MAL), and a Problem Score. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was determined at the onset of the study. RESULTS: One week after the last treatment session, a significant difference in effectiveness in favor of the forced use group compared with the bimanual group (corrected for baseline differences) was found for the ARA score (3.0 points; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 4.8; MCID, 5.7 points) and the MAL amount of use score (0.52 points; 95{\%} CI, 0.11 to 0.93; MCID, 0.50). The other parameters revealed no significant differential effects. One-year follow-up effects were observed only for the ARA. The differences in treatment effect for the ARA and the MAL amount of use scores were clinically relevant for patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a small but lasting effect of forced use therapy on the dexterity of the affected arm (ARA) and a temporary clinically relevant effect on the amount of use of the affected arm during activities of daily living (MAL amount of use). The effect of forced use therapy was clinically relevant in the subgroups of patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect, respectively.},

abstract = {Background: Adaptive aerosol delivery (AAD) nebuliser devices can reduce treatment times whilst enabling adherence to be monitored using inbuilt data logs. Using one such device, we have monitored nebulised antibiotic adherence in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Methods: In CF children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, downloaded data from an AAD device was used to calculate morning, evening and overall monthly adherence to antibiotic therapy over a year. Results: Overall monthly adherence to nebulised antibiotic therapy in 28 children was maintained between 60 and 70{\%} over the year. Considerable variation in adherence, both between and within patients, was evident (Mean [SD] coefficient of variation, 37[44]{\%}). Evening adherence (75[37]{\%}) was better than morning adherence (58[34]{\%}: p = 0.012). Treatment regimens were changed in 8/28 patients based on adherence data. Conclusions: Routine adherence monitoring can be implemented in an outpatient setting. Using this type of information it is possible to identify which aspects of treatment can be improved and to work together with families to individualise treatments. ?? 2009 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {This essay critically explores the role of technological innovation in the constitution of chronic states and illness. Drawing on the co-construction of technology and society perspective, it focuses more specifically on the way in which innovation designers envisage the enhancement of the chronically ill and build certain kinds of socio-technical configuration to deal with chronic illness. Using the case of ;intelligent distance patient monitoring' as an illustration, the paper argues that technology creates as much as it solves the problem of chronic illness. Technology is recursively embedded in chronic illness and it generates dual effects: it constrains and sustains users' daily practices. Only by recognizing technology's duality and eventually transcending it will research and policy initiatives be able to deal creatively and responsibly with the design of our future health experiences.},

@article{Cochrane_Intervention4MotorApraxia,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apraxia is a cognitive disorder that can occur after stroke. It prevents a person from carrying out a learned movement. Various interventions are used to treat apraxia but evidence of their benefit has been lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine which therapeutic interventions targeted at motor apraxia reduce disability. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 2006). In addition, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1980 to November 2006), CINAHL (1982 to November 2006), PsycINFO (1974 to November 2006), the Research Index of the Occupational Therapy Journal (searched November 2006), REHABDATA (1956 to November 2006), the National Research Register (searched November 2006) and Current Controlled Trials Register (searched November 2006). We reviewed the reference lists of all articles that we identified as relevant. We made efforts to find both published and unpublished trials by writing to key authors and journals. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of therapeutic intervention for motor apraxia in stroke. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author searched the titles, abstracts and keywords. Four review authors extracted data and analysed trial quality. We contacted investigators for further details of trials if necessary. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials including a total of 132 participants were included in the review. There was evidence of a small and short-lived therapeutic effect in the two studies that reported change in activities of daily living (102 participants) but this was not considered clinically significant and did not persist at the longer-term follow up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions for motor apraxia after stroke. Further research of higher quality is required. As we did not review whether patients with apraxia benefit from rehabilitation input in general, they should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services.},

@article{Nef_EffectsArmTraining,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several clinical studies on chronic stroke conducted with end-effector-based robots showed improvement of the motor function in the affected arm. Compared to end-effector-based robots, exoskeleton robots provide improved guidance of the human limb and are better suited to train task-oriented movements with a large range of motions. OBJECTIVE: To test whether intensive arm training with the arm exoskeleton ARMin I is feasible with chronic-stroke patients and whether it improves motor function in the paretic arm. METHODS: Three single cases with chronic hemiparesis resulting from unilateral stroke (at least 14 months after stroke). A-B design with 2 weeks of multiple baseline measurements (A), 8 weeks of training (B) with repetitive measurements and a follow-up measurement 8 weeks after training. The training included shoulder and elbow movements with the robotic rehabilitation device ARMin I. Two subjects had three 1-hour sessions per week and 1 subject received five 1-hour sessions per week. The main outcome measurement was the upper-limb part of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). RESULTS: The ARMin training was well tolerated by the patients, and the FMA showed moderate, but significant improvements for all 3 subjects (p < 0.05). Most improvements were maintained 8 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that intensive training with an arm exoskeleton is feasible with chronic-stroke patients. Moderate improvements were found in all 3 subjects, thus further clinical investigations are justified.},

abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the use of specialised medical equipment by patients at home has increased in most industrialised countries. Adopting a conceptual framework that brings together two research perspectives, i.e. the sociology of technology and the sociology of illness, this paper empirically examines why and how patients use health technology at home and in the broader social world. Our study compares and contrasts the use of four interventions: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. We conducted interviews with patients (n = 16) and caregivers (n = 6), and made direct observations of home visits by nurses (n = 16). The content and structure of patient manuals distributed by major manufacturers and hospitals were analysed (n = 26). The aim of our study was to determine how technology was supposed to be used versus how it was actually used. This study shows that patients are deeply ambivalent about the benefits and drawbacks of technology, and that these advantages and disadvantages are shaped by the various places in which the technology is used. While technology can be pivotal in making patients autonomous and able to participate in the social world, it also imposes heavy restrictions that are intimately interwoven with the nature of the particular disease and with the patient's personal life trajectory.},

However, the compliance by young children and adolescents to undertake such physiotherapy can lead to confrontation and stressful situations within families, and can impact on the health of the individual. We have developed game software which is controlled through breathing into a PEP mask or mouthpiece using an air pressure sensor to interface with the PC. By combining games with mucus clearing devices, it could provide a powerful means of encouraging children, teenagers and adults to engage more frequently, and effectively, with vital mucus clearance physiotherapy. This paper presents promising initial results and describes further usability testing plans.},

abstract = {We investigated whether children with neurological gait disorders who walked in a driven gait orthosis could adjust their participation level according to the demands of a newly developed rehabilitation game. We further investigated if cognitive capacity and motor impairment influenced game performance. Nineteen children with neurological gait disorders (mean age: 13.4y, 42{\%} girls) participated. To quantify game participation, electromyographic muscle activity (M. rectus femoris) and heart rate were compared in a demanding part and a less demanding part of the game. Cognitive capacity was assessed with the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (TONI-4). Furthermore, the Functional Independence Measure for Children (WeeFIM), Manual Muscle Tests and a therapist-derived score of how well the child was able to train were assessed. Results showed that muscle activity and heart rate were higher during the demanding part of the game (30.7. ±. 22.6. $\mu$V; 129.4. ±. 15.7. bpm) compared to the less demanding part (16.0. ±. 13.4. $\mu$V; 124.1. ±. 15.9. bpm; p<. 0.01 for both measures). Game performance correlated moderately with the TONI-4 (r= 0.50, p = 0.04) and the cognition subscale of the WeeFIM ($\rho$= 0.59, p= 0.01). The therapist-derived score correlated significantly with game performance (p= 0.75, p<. 0.01) and the ability to modify muscle activity to the demands of the game (p= -0.72, p<. 0.01). Receiver operating characteristic analyses revealed that the latter factor differentiated well between those children suitable for the game and those not. We conclude that children with neurological gait disorders are able to modify their activity to the demands of the VR-scenario. However, cognitive function and motor impairment determine to which extent. These results are important for clinical decision-making. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatments is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

They operate within strict parameters and in many cases this behaviour seems robust, implying that noise is largely filtered by the system.

abstract = {A VR-based system using a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove was used to rehabilitate four post-stroke patients in the chronic phase. Each patient had to perform a variety of VR exercises to reduce impairments in their finger range of motion, speed, fractionation and strength. Patients exercised for about two hours per day, five days a week for three weeks. Results showed that three of the patients had gains in thumb range (50-140{\%}) and finger speed (10-15{\%}) over the three weeks trial. All four patients had significant improvement in finger fractionation (40-118{\%}). Gains in finger strength were modest, due in part to an unexpected hardware malfunction. Two of the patients were measured against one-month post intervention and showed good retention. Evaluation using the Jebsen Test of Hand Function showed a reduction of 23-28{\%} in time completion for two of the patients (the ones with the higher degrees of impairment). A prehension task was performed 9-40{\%} faster for three of the patients after the intervention illustrating transfer of their improvement to a functional task.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted therapy offers a promising approach to neurorehabilitation, particularly for severely to moderately impaired stroke patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of intensive arm training on motor performance in four chronic stroke patients using the robot ARMin II. METHODS: ARMin II is an exoskeleton robot with six degrees of freedom (DOF) moving shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Four volunteers with chronic (>or= 12 months post-stroke) left side hemi-paresis and different levels of motor severity were enrolled in the study. They received robot-assisted therapy over a period of eight weeks, three to four therapy sessions per week, each session of one hour.Patients 1 and 4 had four one-hour training sessions per week and patients 2 and 3 had three one-hour training sessions per week. Primary outcome variable was the Fugl-Meyer Score of the upper extremity Assessment (FMA), secondary outcomes were the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), the Maximal Voluntary Torques (MVTs) and a questionnaire about ADL-tasks, progress, changes, motivation etc. RESULTS: Three out of four patients showed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the main outcome. The improvements in the FMA scores were aligned with the objective results of MVTs. Most improvements were maintained or even increased from discharge to the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Data clearly indicate that intensive arm therapy with the robot ARMin II can significantly improve motor function of the paretic arm in some stroke patients, even those in a chronic state. The findings of the study provide a basis for a subsequent controlled randomized clinical trial.},

abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multi-modal – gesture and speech – driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR- applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of cross-modal temporal and semantic coherences , a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph- based) representation and into the dynamic (render-loop and immersion) aspects of a real- time application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multi-modal and scene-context related evaluation procedures for VR-setups. As an example for the concepts usefulness, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described. Introduction},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) is the most commonly used method of airway clearance (AC) in Canada for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) whereas, in some countries, high frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is the preferred form of AC. There have been no long-term studies comparing the efficacy of HFCWO and PEP in the CF population.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To determine the long-term efficacy of HFCWO compared with PEP mask therapy in the treatment of CF as measured by the number of pulmonary exacerbations (PEs).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A randomised controlled study was performed in 12 CF centres in Canada. After a 2-month washout period, subjects were randomised to perform either HFCWO or PEP mask therapy for 1 year.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 107 subjects were enrolled in the study; 51 were randomised to PEP and 56 to HFCWO. There were 19 dropouts within the study period, of which 16 occurred prior to or at the time of randomisation. There were significant differences between the groups in the mean number of PEs (1.14 for PEP vs 2.0 for HFCWO) and time to first PE (220 days for PEP vs 115 days for HFCWO, p=0.02). There was no significant difference in lung function, health-related quality of life scores or patient satisfaction scores between the two groups. PEP mask therapy required a shorter treatment time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study favour PEP and do not support the use of HFCWO as the primary form of AC in patients with CF.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00817180.},

abstract = {Clearance of infected airway secretions is essential to preserve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the value of regular airway clearance treatments has been shown in many studies, adherence to the prescribed treatments is not very good (see Making airway clearance successful, pp. 000-000). In the past the only method available was conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT; also known as manual percussion and postural drainage). CCPT remains the 'gold standard' of airway clearance methods and may be the best choice for some patients, such as infants and young children. However, the many newer methods of airway clearance available now allow CF patients and their families to choose the techniques and devices that best suits them. Most of the newer airway clearance devices have been studied in comparison to standard chest physiotherapy and most studies show no advantage of one method over another. This review will describe newer airway clearance devices available for CF patients and discuss evidence for the effectiveness of these devices compared to standard chest physiotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation has become popular as one approach to helping patients recover function post-stroke. Robotic rehabilitation requires four important elements to match the robot to the patient: realistic biomechanical robotic elements, an assistive control scheme enabled through the human-robot interface, a task oriented rehabilitation program based on the principles of plasticity, and objective assessment tools to monitor change. This paper reports on a randomized clinical trial utilizing a complete robot-assisted rehabilitation system for the recovery of upper limb function in patients post-stroke. In this study, a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) upper limb exoskeleton robot (UL-EXO7) is applied in a rehabilitation clinical trial for patients stable post-stroke (greater than six months). Patients had a Fugl-Meyer Score between 16-39, were mentally alert (> 19 on the VA Mini Mental Status Exam) and were between 27 and 70 years of age. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: bilateral robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and usual care. This study is concerned with the changes in kinematics in the two robotic groups. Both patient groups played eight therapeutic video games over 12 sessions (90 min, two times a week). In each session, patients intensively played the different combination of video games that directly interacted with UL-EXO7 under the supervision of research assistant. At each session, all of the joint angle data was recorded for the evaluation of therapeutic effects. A new assessment metric is reported along with conventional metrics. The experimental result shows that both groups of patients showed consistent improvement with respect to the proposed and conventional metrics.},

@article{Ma_SG4MovTherapy,
abstract = {This paper details the development and testing of a serious-game based movement therapy aimed at encouraging stroke patients with upper limb motor disorders to practice physical exercises. The system contains a series of Virtual Reality (VR) games. A framework for VR movement therapy is described which consists of a number of serious games designed to encourage patients' physical activity in highly motivating, virtual environments where various factors such as size and gravity can be scaled to adapt to individual patient's abilities and in-game performance. Another goal of this study is to determine whether the provision of serious games based interventions improves motor outcome after stroke. A pilot study with 8 participants who have a first hemispheric stroke shows improvements on impairment measurement and functional measurement shortly after completion of the intervention and 6 weeks after the intervention. Despite its limitations the findings of this study support the effectiveness of serious games in the treatment of participants with hemiplegia. The study also raises awareness of the benefits of using serious games in movement therapy after stroke.},

abstract = {Background: Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50{\%}. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50{\%} for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27{\%} to 46{\%}. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {Current neuroscience has identified several constructs to increase the effectiveness of upper extremity rehabilitation. One is the use of progressive, skill acquisition-oriented training. Another approach emphasizes the use of bilateral activities. Building on these principles, this paper describes the design and feasibility testing of a robotic / virtual environment system designed to train the arm of persons who have had strokes. The system provides a variety of assistance modes, scalable workspaces and hand-robot interfaces allowing persons with strokes to train multiple joints in three dimensions. The simulations utilize assistance algorithms that adjust task difficulty both online and offline in relation to subject performance. Several distinctive haptic effects have been incorporated into the simulations. An adaptive master-slave relationship between the unimpaired and impaired arm encourages active movement of the subject's hemiparetic arm during a bimanual task. Adaptive anti-gravity support and damping stabilize the arm during virtual reaching and placement tasks. An adaptive virtual spring provides assistance to complete the movement if the subject is unable to complete the task in time. Finally, haptically rendered virtual objects help to shape the movement trajectory during a virtual placement task. A proof of concept study demonstrated this system to be safe, feasible and worthy of further study.},

abstract = {Background: Active video games are used in many hospitals as exercise tools for children with cystic fibrosis. However, the exercise intensity associated with playing these games has not been examined in this population. Methods: Children with cystic fibrosis [n=30, aged 12.3 (2.6) years, 17 boys, BMI 17.7 (2.8) kg/m2] were recruited from outpatient clinics in Dublin hospitals. Age and gender matched control children were recruited from local schools. Oxygen consumption, metabolic equivalents (METs) calculated from resting V̇O2, and heart rate were measured while playing Nintendo Wii™ (Nintendo Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) Sports Boxing and Nintendo Wii Fit Free Jogging using a portable indirect calorimeter (Oxycon Mobile). Results: Playing Wii Boxing resulted in light intensity activity (2.46. METs) while playing Wii Fit Free Jogging resulted in moderate intensity physical activity (4.44. METs). No significant difference was seen between groups in the energy cost of playing active video games. Conclusion: Active video games are a useful source of light to moderate intensity physical activity in children with cystic fibrosis. © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {Recovery of upper extremity function is particularly recalcitrant to successful rehabilitation. Robotic-assisted arm training devices integrated with virtual targets or complex virtual reality gaming simulations are being developed to deal with this problem. Neural control mechanisms indicate that reaching and hand-object manipulation are interdependent, suggesting that training on tasks requiring coordinated effort of both the upper arm and hand may be a more effective method for improving recovery of real world function. However, most robotic therapies have focused on training the proximal, rather than distal effectors of the upper extremity. This paper describes the effects of robotically-assisted, integrated upper extremity training.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Escherichia coli is the most frequent pathogen in both acute bacterial prostatitis and acute uncomplicated urinary infections. To assess the virulence profiles of E. coli in acute prostatitis, the serotypes and virulence factor (VF) genotypes were determined. METHODS: We studied 107 E. coli isolates from cases of acute bacterial prostatitis, 76 isolates from acute pyelonephritis, 194 isolates from acute Cystitis and 80 fecal isolates from healthy people. All pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates were from women. Seven urovirulence determinants were analyzed by DNA colony hybridization, including the genes for type 1 fimbria (pil), P fimbria (pap), S fimbria (sfa), afimbrial adhesin AFA-I (afaI), alpha-hemolysin (hly), cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1) and aerobactin (aer). O:H:K serotypes were also determined. RESULTS: With the exception of pil and afaI, all VFs were significantly more often associated with prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates than with the fecal isolates. The prevalence of sfa, hly and cnf1 was higher in prostatitis isolates than in pyelonephritis and cystitis isolates, and the pap+sfa+hly+cnf1+ genotype was dominant among prostatitis isolates (48.8{\%}). Nine O serotype (O1, O2, O4, O6, O16, O18, O22, O25 and O75) accounted for 79.4{\%}, 73.7{\%} and 78.4{\%} of the prostatitis, pyelonephritis and cystitis strains, respectively. There was an apparent correlation between serotype and genotype in uropathogenic E. coli. CONCLUSION: The predominance of O serotypes in female urinary tract infections and a high percentage of multiple VFs among the prostatitis isolates suggested that VFs play important roles in the pathogenesis of acute bacterial prostatitis.},

abstract = {Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to 'transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.},

abstract = {This document describes the implementation of the DocStrip program. The original version of this program was developed by Frank Mittelbach to accompany his doc.sty which enables literate programming in LATEX. Denys Duchier rewrote it to run either with TEX or with LATEX, and to allow full boolean expressions in conditional guards instead of just comma-separated lists. Johannes Braams re-united the two implementations, documented and debugged the code. In September 1995 Marcin Woliński changed many parts of the program to make use of TEX’s ability to write to multiple files at the same time to avoid re-reading sources. The performance improvement of version 2.3 came at a price of compatibility with some more obscure operating systems which limit the number of files a process can keep open. This was corrected in September 1996 by Mark Wooding and his changes were “creatively merged” by Marcin Woliński who made at the same time changes in batch files processing, handling of preambles and introduced “verbatim mode”. After all that, David Carlisle merged the new version into the LATEX sources, and made a few other changes, principally making DocStrip work under initex, and removing the need for batch files to say $\backslash$def$\backslash$batchfile{\{}...{\}}.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by dehydration of airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, there is difficulty clearing pathogens from the lung, and patients experience chronic pulmonary infections and inflammation. Clearance of airway secretions has been a primary therapy for those with CF, and a variety of airway clearance therapies (ACTs) have been developed. Because ACTs are intrusive and require considerable time and effort, it is important that appropriate techniques are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. Therefore, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for each therapy and provide guidance for their use. A systematic review was commissioned, which identified 7 unique reviews and 13 additional controlled trials that addressed one or more of the comparisons of interest and were deemed eligible for inclusion. Recommendations for use of the ACTs were made, balancing the quality of evidence and the potential harms and benefits. The committee determined that, although there is a paucity of controlled trials that assess the long-term effects of ACTs, the evidence quality overall for their use in CF is fair and the benefit is moderate. The committee recommends airway clearance be performed on a regular basis in all patients. There are no ACTs demonstrated to be superior to others, so the prescription of ACTs should be individualized. Aerobic exercise is recommended as an adjunctive therapy for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to determine whether non immersive interactive virtual environments are an effective medium for training individuals who suffer from Unilateral Spatial Neglect (USN) as a result of a right hemisphere stroke, and to compare it to a standard computer visual scanning training. METHOD: Participants included 19 patients with right hemisphere stroke in two groups, 11 in an experimental group were given computer desktop-based Virtual Reality (VR) street crossing training and 8 in a control group who were given computer based visual scanning tasks, both for a total of twelve sessions, 9 hours total, over four weeks. Measures included: 1. Standard USN assessments, paper and pencil and ADL checklist; 2. Test on the VR street program; and 3. Actual street crossing videotaped. Testing was performed pre and post intervention. RESULTS: The VR group achieved on the USN measures results that equaled those achieved by the control group treated with conventional visual scanning tasks. They improved more on the VR test and they did better on some measures of the real street crossing. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several limitations in this study the present results support the effectiveness of the VR street program in the treatment of participants with USN, and further development of the program.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how medical specialists view health technology assessment (HTA) and its role in policy-making. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 28 medical specialists practising in Quebec and Ontario (Canada) to examine their views on an HTA report relevant to their specialty (prostate-specific antigen screening, electroconvulsive therapy and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome). RESULTS: Medical specialists represent a particularly demanding audience for HTA producers because they are knowledgeable about current studies in their field and often contribute to the evidence base that HTA seeks to synthesize. In all three cases, specialists not only challenged specific points in the content of the HTA reports but also offered different and sometimes conflicting appraisals of the clinical relevance and policy implications. More than just the timeliness and usefulness of HTA findings are at issue. The views of specialists are grounded in a clinical understanding of what counts as evidence and how decisions should be made, a view that contrasts with the societal perspective of HTA. CONCLUSIONS: HTA producers cannot afford to overlook medical specialists who play a key role in the adoption of health technologies. Establishing a transparent dialogue between producers and users of HTA reports could enrich policy recommendations.},

Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage. Earlier diagnosis has prevented serious complications through early initiation of preventive therapies such as improved nutrition.},

abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations1, 2, 3. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-4, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks5, 6 and in the decrease of precision of cell signals7. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

abstract = {Bone dissection is an important component of many sur- gical procedures. In this paper, we discuss adaptive tech- niques for providing real-time haptic and visual feedback during a virtual bone dissection simulation. The simulator is being developed as a component of a training system for temporal bone surgery. We harness the difference in com- plexity and frequency requirements of the visual and hap- tic simulations by modeling the system as a collection of loosely coupled concurrent components. The haptic com- ponent exploits a multi-resolution representation of the first two moments of the bone characteristic function to rapidly compute contact forces and determine bone erosion. The visual component uses a time-critical particle system evo- lution method to simulate secondary visual effects, such as bone debris accumulation, blooding, irrigation, and suc- tion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Problems with sleep, eating and adherence to therapy may adversely affect health outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6{\%}; moderate/large problem: 21.9{\%}), eating (32.4{\%}) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4{\%}). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3{\%}), anxiety (16.4{\%}) and stress (34.2{\%}). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95{\%} CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment adherence is crucial in patients with cystic fibrosis, but poor adherence is a problem, especially during adolescence. Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60{\%} of the patients and by 62{\%} of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},

There is evidence that the training duration is a key factor for the therapy progress. Robot-supported therapy can improve the rehabilitation allowing more intensive training. This paper presents the kinematics, the control and the therapy modes of the arm therapy robot ARMin. It is a haptic display with semi-exoskeleton kinematics with four active and two passive degrees of freedom. Equipped with position, force and torque sensors the device can deliver patient-cooperative arm therapy taking into account the activity of the patient and supporting him/her only as much as needed. The haptic display is combined with an audiovisual display that is used to present the movement and the movement task to the patient. It is assumed that the patient-cooperative therapy approach combined with a multimodal display can increase the patient's motivation and activity and, therefore, the therapeutic progress.},

abstract = {Stroke is the main cause of disabilities in the world and is typically treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after the initial injury. However, due to economic pressures, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner, so the potential benefit of the therapy is not completely realized. Thus, it is important to develop rehabilitation technology that allows individuals who had suffered a stroke to practice intensive movement training without the expense of an always-present therapist. Although several robotic devices have been developed for stroke rehabilitation, these are too expensive for use at home or in small clinics.We have developed a low-cost alternative that allows stroke survivors to practice arm movement exercises at home or at the clinic, with periodic interactions with a therapist. The system integrates a virtual environment for facilitating repetitive movement training, with computer vision algorithms that track the hand of a patient, using an inexpensive camera and a conventional personal computer. This system, called Gesture Therapy, has been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial at a hospital in Mexico City, comparing it with conventional occupational therapy. The results show that both treatments improve the functionality of the affected upper extremity, with not significant difference between them. However, the patients that used the virtual environment have a greater motivation and attachment to the treatment, which in the long term are decisive for maximal recovery.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50{\%} of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To estimate the return on investment (ROI) of a workplace initiative to reduce work-family conflict in a group-randomized 18-month field experiment in an information technology firm in the United States. METHODS Intervention resources were micro-costed; benefits included medical costs, productivity (presenteeism), and turnover. Regression models were used to estimate the ROI, and cluster-robust bootstrap was used to calculate its confidence interval. RESULTS For each participant, model-adjusted costs of the intervention were {\$}690 and company savings were {\$}1850 (2011 prices). The ROI was 1.68 (95{\%} confidence interval, -8.85 to 9.47) and was robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION The positive ROI indicates that employers' investment in an intervention to reduce work-family conflict can enhance their business. Although this was the first study to present a confidence interval for the ROI, results are comparable with the literature.},

abstract = {Young people with long-term medical conditions eventually have to 'transfer' from child to adult care. Transition involves careful planning and preparation for this event. Predictors for successful transition include increasing independence, active involvement in self-care and the ability to independently discuss care with the doctor. However, many young people and their families feel that they are not adequately prepared for transition. They can find it difficult to get information in an appropriate, age-related format. Therefore there is interest in how information can be presented in a youth-friendly way and how technology might support this. We have reviewed the literature for issues that are common to young people with long-term conditions and their needs as they move into adult care. The impact of computer games on healthcare education was also reviewed with findings extrapolated to scenarios where they might be of benefit during transition. Several computer games have been developed and evaluated in young people. Improvements in knowledge, self-efficacy, adherence to treatment and improved communication were reported. However the games were often disease specific meaning that their information cannot be generalised to other long term conditions. Some of the important skills required for transition include self-advocacy, teaching of age appropriate self-management, improved communication skills, understanding the importance of compliance to drug therapies and awareness of potential side effects as well as understanding of and being able to distinguish between similar conditions. Some of the inherent characteristics of games which could promote acquisition of these skills include goals, feedback, rewards, challenges and the ability to invoke curiosity and hence encourage involvement in the care process. We have made recommendations for design features that would allow the creation of games for transitional care which would reinforce appropriate skills and provide a format for delivering important health care information. Caveats are the acceptance of games by the young person, different ages and genders as well as by the clinical team. Therefore it will be very important to include these stakeholders when designing and developing health education games.},

abstract = {There is increasing recognition that we need better ways to account for the social, economic and environmental value that results from our activities. The language varies – ‘impact’, ‘returns’, ‘benefit’, ‘value’ – but the questions around what sort of difference and how much of a difference we are making are the same. Understanding and managing this broader value is becoming increasingly important for the public and private sectors alike. This is true whether it is civil society organisations working to create value, Governments commissioning and investing in activities to create social value, investors seeking to ensure that their investments will make a difference, or private businesses recognising both risk and opportunity in the wider effects of operations. All this means that it is also more important that we have some consistency and a shared language when we talk about value. SROI is the application of a set of principles within a framework that is designed to help bring about that consistency, whilst at the same time recognising that what is of value will be very different for different people in different situations and cultures.},

@article{Banke-Thomas2015,
abstract = {Background: Increased scarcity of public resources has led to a concomitant drive to account for value-for-money of interventions. Traditionally, cost-effectiveness, cost-utility and cost-benefit analyses have been used to assess value-for-money of public health interventions. The social return on investment (SROI) methodology has capacity to measure broader socio-economic outcomes, analysing and computing views of multiple stakeholders in a singular monetary ratio. This review provides an overview of SROI application in public health, explores lessons learnt from previous studies and makes recommendations for future SROI application in public health. Methods: A systematic review of peer-reviewed and grey literature to identify SROI studies published between January 1996 and December 2014 was conducted. All articles describing conduct of public health SROI studies and which reported a SROI ratio were included. An existing 12-point framework was used to assess study quality. Data were extracted using pre-developed codes: SROI type, type of commissioning organisation, study country, public health area in which SROI was conducted, stakeholders included in study, discount rate used, SROI ratio obtained, time horizon of analysis and reported lessons learnt. Results: 40 SROI studies, of varying quality, including 33 from high-income countries and 7 from low middle-income countries, met the inclusion criteria. SROI application increased since its first use in 2005 until 2011, declining afterwards. SROI has been applied across different public health areas including health promotion (12 studies), mental health (11), sexual and reproductive health (6), child health (4), nutrition (3), healthcare management (2), health education and environmental health (1 each). Qualitative and quantitative methods have been used to gather information for public health SROI studies. However, there remains a lack of consensus on who to include as beneficiaries, how to account for counterfactual and appropriate study-time horizon. Reported SROI ratios vary widely (1.1:1 to 65:1).},

abstract = {One of the principles of SROI is to only include what is material. The Guide to SROI provides some guid- ance on this on pages 22, 35, 85, and 92. This supplement expands the guidance in relation to determin- ing materiality in SROI analyses that would be made public, and would meet the Assurance standard for public reports. The principle states: ‘Determine what information and evidence must be included in the accounts to give a true and fair picture, such that stakeholders can draw reasonable conclusions about impact.’ This principle requires an assessment of whether a person would make a different decision about the ac- tivity if a particular piece of information were excluded. This covers decisions about which stakeholders experience significant change, as well as the information about the outcomes. Deciding what is material requires reference to the organisation’s own policies, its peers, societal norms, and short-term financial impacts. For SROI analyses which will be public documents and meet the standard required for assurance, mate- riality means that the material outcomes for all stakeholders should be included. The principle of verifica- tion and third party assurance of public documents is important in order to give those using the account comfort that material issues have been included. For other audiences and purposes, the scope may mean limitations to the analysis. Materiality will then be assessed within the limitations established by the scope. Separate supplementary guidance is being developed on scope and on SROI analyses for different audiences.},

The adaptability of such systems to match each person's need and rehabilitation goal remains problematic. This paper presents a rapid prototyping approach for customising gaming technology using various affordable commercial devices and open source software. We first demonstrate how a freely available game is adapted for training disabled people through different sensors and control modes. We then show how an open online virtual world such as Second Life ® offers sufficient conditions for quickly building custom content for testing with interactive devices. When presented with these prototyping possibilities, people from the target groups (healthcare professionals, patients, people with disabilities, older people, families) related such systems to their needs and further elaborated on the use of such systems.

Consider, for instance, the entrepreneur’s ability to secure investment, the viability of the business plan, and the enterprise’s ability to adapt and respond to fluctuating market conditions. Further, because a successful enterprise must, by definition, be income-generating, gauging the extent to which the organization is able to realize its goals as a result of having sought out and received private investments has become an integral aspect of this work. As such, not only does “success” mean many things within the social investment space, but demonstrating “success” requires attention to many moving parts within an organization as well.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our centre's median forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) reported in the 2005 Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Foundation Patient Registry was below the national median. The focus of our quality improvement initiative was to improve lung function through re-education of airway clearance techniques (REACT)., AIM: The global aim was to improve the median FEV1 in our patients. The specific aim was to encourage adherence to airway clearance techniques (ACT). To achieve these goals we implemented the REACT programme for patients., METHODS: Educational sessions introduced the concept of improving clinical outcomes and the importance of airway clearance in achieving optimal lung function. The REACT programme utilised an anonymous survey, in-clinic questionnaire and ACT demonstration to assess knowledge, practices and barriers to ACT. Patients were then categorised as non-adherent or adherent with correct or incorrect technique. Improper techniques were corrected. All patients were re-educated on the rationale for ACT., RESULTS: Our surveys revealed that 43{\%} of patients had barriers to ACT and 53{\%} were non-adherent. Following implementation of REACT, median FEV1 increased from 84{\%} to 92{\%} (national median 91-94{\%}) from 2005 to 2010 for patients aged 6-17. For patients 18 and older, median FEV1 increased from 56{\%} to 64{\%} (national median 62-65{\%}) from 2005 to 2010., CONCLUSIONS: By introducing a programme focused on technique and adherence, we were able to improve median FEV1 in patients with CF. Sustained improvement of FEV1 was accomplished by continued use of the REACT programme.},

abstract = {The clearance of secretions from the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) is an important component in the fight to preserve their lung function. There is excessive inflammation in the airways of these patients, which is thought to be exaggerated by ineffective mucociliary clearance and bacterial infection. In 2005 the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation formed the Pulmonary Therapies Committee to review all of the medical literature on the various airway-clearance therapies used in treating CF lung disease. The recommendations were: an airway-clearance therapy should be performed by all patients with CF, no form of airway-clearance therapy stood out as being superior to another, and that patients may express a preference of one therapy over another. They also concluded that aerobic exercise is beneficial to patients with CF, as it is to everyone, and that exercise should be a component to the overall health routine of patients with CF. The challenge for respiratory and physical therapists together with the patient/family is to develop a plan of attack through the use of various airway-clearance therapies. The respiratory and physical therapists are integral in helping patients and families develop airway-clearance routines that aid in the removal of the secretions that cause airway obstruction. There is a wide range of airway-clearance therapies that therapists can choose from when they are teaching the patients and family members the strategies of secretion removal. The questions are: What therapy is best for what age or stage of lung disease? What therapies will the patient do? And which therapies will be covered by medical insurance? These are all fundamental questions that must be answered when guiding families in finding therapies that are effective and appropriate for each CF patient's unique situation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The management of cystic fibrosis (CF) includes adherence to a home management program (airway clearance, medication, nutritional advice, and exercise). This has led to an increase in life expectancy, although the benefits depend greatly on a patient's level of adherence to daily treatments at home. To date, no systematic review has established adherence rates to all World Health Organization guidelines in the home setting; hence, this review was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The review comprised 3 phases. A methodological assessment of databases (Embase, CINAHL, PsychINFO, PEDro, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) identified potentially relevant papers. These papers were screened for inclusion criteria by 2 independent reviewers, data were extracted, and the internal validity was rated using a valid and reliable scale. Results were categorized into 4 themes: medication, nutrition, airway clearance techniques, and exercise.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The search generated a total of 26 papers, 24 of which were rated as being poor quality. Adherence to a treatment program for CF patients is generally low (from 22{\%} for nutritional guidelines to 130{\%} for oral antibiotics), and it varies greatly depending on the type of treatment and the method of assessment employed (objective tool vs self-reported questionnaires).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Consensus on how to measure adherence is lacking, and the quality of studies addressing adherence in this population is generally poor. Overall, studies using self-reported measures yielded higher adherence scores than those that used objective measures, suggesting that current efforts to improve methods of adherence are appropriate.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to control the symptoms and the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Many types of nebuliser systems are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous systematic review which has evaluated these systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness, safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser systems for people with cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: The search identified 40 studies with 20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, patient preference and adherence. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials of these technologies to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Exercise is an important treatment modality for persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but factors influencing adherence have been examined infrequently. The purpose of this investigation was to explore adherence factors to a progressive resistance exercise program for persons with COPD. METHODS: Persons with COPD enrolled in a 12-week trial of progressive resistance exercise were invited to participate in 2 semistructured qualitative interviews exploring program adherence. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed, and then coded independently by 2 researchers. Themes relating to short-term and long-term adherence were then developed and described. RESULTS: Twenty-two participants were interviewed at the conclusion of the intervention (12 weeks), and 19 completed a second interview at 24 weeks. Short-term exercise adherence was facilitated by expected outcomes, self-motivation, supervision, and group support, whereas health and weather factors were the major barriers to adherence. The barriers to exercise remained unchanged at 24 weeks despite a large decline in exercise adherence. Removal of environmental support at 12 weeks may have contributed to poor long-term exercise maintenance, with participants identifying group support and regular monitoring by a therapist as the most important strategies for maintaining exercise. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of external support in training program design appears important for persons with COPD. Longer-term adherence declined when group support and regular monitoring by a therapist was removed, despite the major perceived exercise barriers remaining unchanged. Therefore, further investigation is required to determine effective strategies for maximizing longer-term exercise adherence in this population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest physiotherapy is widely prescribed to assist the clearance of airway secretions in people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Positive expiratory pressure (PEP) devices provide constant back pressure to the airways during expiration. This may improve clearance by building up gas behind mucus via collateral ventilation. Given the widespread use of PEP devices, there is a need to determine the evidence for their effect. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and acceptability of PEP devices compared to other forms of physiotherapy as a means of improving mucus clearance and other outcomes in people with CF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising of references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. The electronic database CINAHL was also searched from 1982 to 2001. Most recent search of the Group's register: February 2006. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled studies in which PEP was compared with any other form of physiotherapy in people with CF. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to publications and assessed the quality of the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: Forty studies were identified and twenty-five studies involving 507 participants met the review inclusion criteria. Most included studies had low scores on a scale of study quality. Twenty of these studies involving 300 participants were cross-over in design. Data were not published in sufficient detail in most of these studies to perform meta-analysis.Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) was the most frequently measured outcome. Single interventions or series of treatments continued for up to three months demonstrated no significant difference in effect between PEP and other methods of airway clearance on FEV1. Long-term studies had equivocal or conflicting results regarding the effect on FEV1. Participant preference was reported in nine studies. In all studies with an intervention period of at least one month, measures of participant preference were in favour of PEP. The results for the remaining outcome measures were not examined or reported in sufficient detail to provide any high level evidence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There was no clear evidence that PEP was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. There was limited evidence that PEP was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.},

Effects on clinical outcomes were significant, but much smaller (g= 0.079, 95{\%} CI 0.038; 0.120). Long-termeffects weremaintained for all outcomes except for behavior. Serious games are best individually tailored to both socio-demographic and change need information, and benefit froma strong focus on game theories or a dual theoretical foundation in both behavioral prediction and game theories. They can be effective either as a stand-alone ormulti-component programs, and appeal to populations regardless of age and gender.Giventhat effects of games remainheterogeneous, further explorations ofwhich game features create larger effects are needed.},

abstract = {Clearance of infected airway secretions is essential to preserve lung function in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Although the value of regular airway clearance treatments has been shown in many studies, adherence to the prescribed treatments is not very good (see Making airway clearance successful, pp. 000-000). In the past the only method available was conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT; also known as manual percussion and postural drainage). CCPT remains the 'gold standard' of airway clearance methods and may be the best choice for some patients, such as infants and young children. However, the many newer methods of airway clearance available now allow CF patients and their families to choose the techniques and devices that best suits them. Most of the newer airway clearance devices have been studied in comparison to standard chest physiotherapy and most studies show no advantage of one method over another. This review will describe newer airway clearance devices available for CF patients and discuss evidence for the effectiveness of these devices compared to standard chest physiotherapy. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this evidence-based analysis is to examine the safety and efficacy of airway clearance devices (ACDs) for cystic fibrosis and attempt to differentiate between devices, where possible, on grounds of clinical efficacy, quality of life, safety and/or patient preference. BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common, inherited, life-limiting disease that affects multiple systems of the human body. Respiratory dysfunction is the primary complication and leading cause of death due to CF. CF causes abnormal mucus secretion in the airways, leading to airway obstruction and mucus plugging, which in turn can lead to bacterial infection and further mucous production. Over time, this almost cyclical process contributes to severe airway damage and loss of respiratory function. Removal of airway secretions, termed airway clearance, is thus an integral component of the management of CF. A variety of methods are available for airway clearance, some requiring mechanical devices, others physical manipulation of the body (e.g. physiotherapy). Conventional chest physiotherapy (CCPT), through the assistance of a caregiver, is the current standard of care for achieving airway clearance, particularly in young patients up to the ages of six or seven. CF patients are, however, living much longer now than in decades past. The median age of survival in Canada has risen to 37.0 years for the period of 1998-2002 (5-year window), up from 22.8 years for the 5-year window ending in 1977. The prevalence has also risen accordingly, last recorded as 3,453 in Canada in 2002, up from 1,630 in 1977. With individuals living longer, there is a greater need for independent methods of airway clearance. AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE CLASSES OF AIRWAY CLEARANCE DEVICES: positive expiratory pressure devices (PEP), airway oscillating devices (AOD; either handheld or stationary) and high frequency chest compression (HFCC)/mechanical percussion (MP) devices. Within these classes are numerous different brands of devices from various manufacturers, each with subtle iterations. At least 10 devices are licensed by Health Canada (ranging from Class 1 to Class 3 devices). EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS OF EFFECTIVENESS: RESEARCH QUESTIONS: Does long-term use of ACDs improve outcomes of interest in comparison to CCPT in patients with CF?Does long-term use of one class of ACD improve outcomes of interest in comparison to another class of ACD in CF patients? LITERATURE SEARCH: A comprehensive literature search was performed on March 7, 2009 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing {\&} Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 1950 to March 7, 2009. INCLUSION CRITERIA: All randomized controlled trials including those of parallel and crossover design,Systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), systematic reviews and meta-analyses EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Abstracts were generally excluded because their methods could not be examined; however, abstract data was included in several Cochrane meta-analyses presented in this paper;Studies of less than seven days duration (including single treatment studies);Studies that did not report primary outcomes;Studies in which less than 10 patients completed the study. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST: Primary outcomes under review were percent-predicted forced expiratory volume (FEV-1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and forced expiratory flow between 25{\%}-75{\%} (FEF25-75). Secondary outcomes included number of hospitalizations, adherence, patient preference, quality of life and adverse events. All outcomes were decided a priori. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS: Literature searching and back-searching identified 13 RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria, along with three Cochrane systematic reviews. The Cochrane reviews were identified in preliminary searching and used as the basis for formulating this review. Results were subgrouped by comparison and according to the available literature. For example, results from Cochrane meta-analyses included abstract data and therefore, additional meta-analyses were also performed on trials reported as full publications only (MAS generally excludes abstracted data when full publications are available as the methodological quality of trials reported in abstract cannot be properly assessed). Executive Summary Table 1 summarizes the results across all comparisons and subgroupings for primary outcomes of pulmonary function. Only two comparisons yielded evidence of moderate or high quality according to GRADE criteria-the comparisons of CCPT vs. PEP and handheld AOD vs. PEP-but only the comparison of CCPT vs. PEP noted a significant difference between treatment groups. In comparison to CCPT, there was a significant difference in favour of PEP for {\%} predicted FEV-1 and FVC according to one long-term, parallel RCT. This trial was accepted as the best available evidence for the comparison. The body of evidence for the remaining comparisons was low to very low, according to GRADE criteria, being downgraded most often because of poor methodological quality and low generalizability. Specifically, trials were likely not adequately powered (low sample sizes), did not conduct intention-to-treat analyses, were conducted primarily in children and young adolescents, and outdated (conducted more than 10 years ago). Secondary outcomes were poorly or inconsistently reported, and were generally not of value to decision-making. Of note, there were a significantly higher number of hospitalizations among participants undergoing AOD therapy in comparison to PEP therapy.

Although the majority of device costs are paid out-of-pocket by the patients themselves, their parents, or covered by third-party medical insurance, Ontario did provide funding assistance through the Assistive Devices Program (ADP) for postural drainage boards and MP devices. These technologies, however, are either obsolete or their clinical efficacy is not supported by evidence. ADP provided roughly {\$}16,000 in funding for the 2008/09 fiscal year. Using device costs and prevalent and incident cases of CF in Ontario, budget impact projections were generated for Ontario. Prevalence of CF in Ontario for patients from ages 6 to 71 was cited as 1,047 cases in 2002 while incidence was estimated at 46 new cases of CF diagnosed per year in 2002. Budget impact projections indicated that PEP and handheld AODs were highly economically feasible costing around {\$}90,000 for the entire prevalent population and less than {\$}3,000 per year to cover new incident cases. HFCC vest devices were by far the most expensive, costing in excess of {\$}19 million to cover the prevalent population alone. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently a lack of sufficiently powered, long-term, parallel randomized controlled trials investigating the use of ACDs in comparison to other airway clearance techniques. While much of the current evidence suggests no significant difference between various ACDs and alternative therapies/technologies, at least according to outcomes of pulmonary function, there is a strong possibility that past trials were not sufficiently powered to identify a difference. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that there will be any future trials comparing ACDs to CCPT as withholding therapy using an ACD may be seen as unethical at present. Conclusions of clinical effectiveness are as follows: Moderate quality evidence suggests that PEP is at least as effective as or more effective than CCPT, according to primary outcomes of pulmonary function.

abstract = {Objective: There are potential benefits of playing videogames for health improvement such as increasing knowledge about health-related issues by playing educational games and fighting a sedentary lifestyle by playing exergames. The number of systematic review articles about videogames and health improvement is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to review those randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with the topic of videogames and health improvement. Materials and Methods: Several electronic databases were searched for RCTs testing videogames on health outcomes that were published in English between January 2000 and April 2012. Results: Forty-five articles met the eligibility criteria and were categorized into five groups: (1) videogames and patient pain and stress reduction (nine articles), (2) videogames and patient behavioral change (19 articles), (3) videogames and patient rehabilitation (eight articles), (4) videogames as diagnostic tools (three articles), and (5) videogames and cognitive ability (six articles). Conclusions: Most of the articles have shown promising results in using videogames within various fields of healthcare. Although exergames are the most prominent choice regarding health improvement, videogames have the potential to be used as a pain management tool, diagnostic tool, or educational tool. They also can be used as a facilitator in physical rehabilitation or cognitive loss prevention. More RCTs are needed to fully uncover the benefits of using videogames for improving patients health. Introduction Since the installation of the first arcade videogame at Stanford University,1 videogames gradually have made their way into the lives of many people. Playing videogames has become one of the important free-time activities among children and young adults.2 School-age children dedicate an average of 60 minutes each day for playing videogames. The gaming industry is booming,3 and this amount of time is likely to be increased. The impact of videogames on everyday activity of children and young people has encouraged scientists to investigate the positive and negative effects of playing videogames on a persons health. There are studies focusing on the two major negative effects of videogame playing. Gentile et al.4 showed that playing videogames increases violence in children.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inhalation of the enzyme dornase alfa reduces sputum viscosity and improves clinical outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis., OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of timing of dornase alfa inhalation on measures of clinical efficacy in people with cystic fibrosis (in relation to airway clearance techniques or time of day)., SEARCH STRATEGY: Relevant randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were identified from the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), and international CF conference proceedings.Search date: 6 October 2010., SELECTION CRITERIA: Any trial of dornase alfa in people with cystic fibrosis where timing of inhalation was the randomised element in the study with either: inhalation before compared to after airway clearance techniques; or morning compared to evening inhalation., DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Both authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data with disagreements resolved by discussion. Relevant data were extracted and, where possible, meta-analysed., MAIN RESULTS: We identified 92 trial reports representing 47 studies, of which five studies (providing data on 122 participants) met our inclusion criteria. All five studies used a cross-over design. Intervention periods ranged from two to eight weeks. Four trials compared dornase alfa inhalation before versus after airway clearance techniques. Inhalation after instead of before airway clearance did not significantly change FEV(1). Similarly, FVC and quality of life were not significantly affected; FEF(25) was significantly worse with dornase alfa inhalation after airway clearance, MD -0.17 litres (95{\%} CI -0.28 to -0.05), based on the pooled data from two small studies in children (7 to 19 years) with well-preserved lung function. All other secondary outcomes were statistically non-significant.In one trial, morning versus evening inhalation had no impact on lung function or symptoms., AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence derived from a small number of participants does not indicate that inhalation of dornase alfa after airway clearance techniques is more or less effective than the traditional recommendation to inhale nebulised dornase alfa 30 minutes prior to airway clearance techniques, for most outcomes. For children with well-preserved lung function, inhalation before airway clearance may be more beneficial for small airway function than inhalation after. However, this result relied on a measure with high variability and studies with variable follow-up. Apart from this, the timing of dornase alfa inhalation can be largely based on pragmatic reasons or individual preference with respect to the time of airway clearance and time of day. Further research is warranted.},

We describe trends in treatment complexity and evaluate its relationship with health outcomes. Methods—Using Epidemiologic Study of Cystic Fibrosis (ESCF) data, we developed a treatment complexity score (TCS) from 37 chronic therapies and assessed change by age group (6–13, 14– 17, and 18+ years) over a three year period. Differences in average site TCS were evaluated by quartiles based on FEV1, BMI, or Treatment Burden score on the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire- Revised (CFQ-R). Results—TCS scores were calculated for 7252 individual patients (42{\%} child, 16{\%} adolescent, 43{\%} adult) across 153 sites. In 2003, mean TCS was 11.1 for children, 11.8 for adolescents, and 12.1 for adults. In all 3 age groups, TCS increased over 3 years; the increase in TCS from 2003– 2005 for children was 1.25 (95{\%} CI 1.16–1.34), for adolescents 0.77 (0.62–0.93), and for adults 1.20 (1.08–1.31) (all p<0.001 for trend over time). At the site level, there were no significant differences in mean TCS based on FEV1 quartile. Mean TCS was higher in the highest BMI z-score quartile. Across all 3 versions of the CFQ-R, mean TCS was lower at sites in the highest quartiles (lowest burden) for CFQ-R Treatment Burden scores. Conclusion—Treatment complexity was highest among adults with CF, although over 3 years, we observed a significant increase in treatment complexity in all age groups. Such increases in treatment complexity pose a challenge to patient self-management and adherence. Future research is needed to understand the associations between treatment complexity and subsequent health outcomes to reduce treatment burden and improve disease management.},

abstract = {Previous work suggests benefit from outpatient exercise and physiotherapy in children with cystic fibrosis (CF), namely improved exercise capacity and lung function measures, as well reduced intravenous (IV) antibiotic needs. Our study aim was to investigate the effect of a year-long supervised outpatient exercise and physiotherapy programme in children with CF. Subjects with CF aged >10 years who had received >4 courses of IV antibiotics in 2009 were enrolled and seen fortnightly for supervised exercise and physiotherapy throughout 2010. In addition, they were expected to exercise three times weekly, and if unwell complete additional physiotherapy sessions extra to usual chest physiotherapy. Assessments of exercise capacity using the Modified Shuttle Test (MST) and quality of life (QOL; CFQ-UK) were recorded at baseline and after 1 year. Regular spirometry was performed before and throughout the study. Data were collected on IV antibiotic days. 12 subjects (6 female) were enrolled with mean (95{\%} CI) age of 13.3 (11.8-14.6) years at study entry. A significant reduction in IV antibiotic days from 60 (56-64) days in 2009 to 50 (44-56) in 2010 (P = 0.02) was noted, along with improved MST distance (m) [735 (603-867) vs. 943 (725-1,161), P = 0.04] and level attained [9.4 (8.4-10.5) vs. 11.1 (9.6-12.6), P = 0.04]. Significant improvements in CFQ-UK scores for physical [59 (47-72) vs. 83 (74-92), P = 0.001], emotional [63 (55-72) vs. 84 (74-93), P < 0.001], treatment [41 (30-51) vs. 61 (48-73), P = 0.002], and respiratory [54 (42-66) vs. 76 (70-82), P = 0.002] domains were noted. The mean (95{\%} CI) rate of change of FEV(1) was -4 (-18, +10){\%} in 2009, but was +6 (-2, +13){\%} in 2010, although this did not reach statistical significance. Supervised, outpatient exercise and physiotherapy are associated with improvements in QOL and exercise tolerance, a reduction in IV antibiotic days, and a trend towards reducing lung function decline in children with CF. The cost of IV antibiotics was reduced by 66,384 ({\$}104,000) in 2010 when compared with 2009. Such cost-benefit may have implications for workforce planning and service provision.Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

As with other segments of the population, it has been difficult to devise exercise programs to which most patients will adhere for long periods of time. In healthy children, factors that are related to positive exercise compliance include social support, perceptions of competency and self-esteem, enjoyment of activity, and availability of a variety of activities. In patients with CF, complications associated with the disease, e.g., time required for other treatment and fatigue, make compliance with recommended exercise activities more difficult. Factors likely to increase compliance in this population include explicit and continued encouragement and support from the family and healthcare team, and the introduction of behavior-changing strategies.},

METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

Methods: Nineteen children with CF (mean age=12.42 years, mean forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1)=90.9{\%} predicted) and their families participated in the study. Caregiver and child participants completed interview-based assessments and were then videotaped during a family mealtime. Results: Mean scores on several domains of family functioning fell in the "unhealthy" range. Better family functioning was found among older children. Better family functioning was also associated with better adherence to antibiotic treatment and worse adherence to enzymes. Conclusions: Findings suggest that family functioning may be an important correlate of treatment adherence in children and adolescents with CF. Future research should replicate these findings in larger samples of children and adolescents with CF.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatments is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) adhere poorly to airway clearance techniques (ACTs), and would rather play video games that challenge their dexterity and visual tracking skills. We developed gaming technology that encourages forced expiratory maneuvers. OBJECTIVE: Following interviews regarding recreational activities and subjects' practice of ACTs, we conducted a pilot trial of spirometer games in 13 adolescents with CF, to test the hypothesis that games could increase subjects' engagement with forced expiratory breathing maneuvers and improve pulmonary function tests (PFTs). METHODS: After baseline PFTs, subjects were provided with digital spirometers and computers set up as "game only" or "control" devices. After the first of 2 periods (each > 2 weeks), the computer was set-up for the alternate condition for period 2. The t test and non-parametric correlation analyses examined use, number of expiratory high flow events (HFEs), and change in PFTs, identifying trends at P ≤ .1, significance at P < .05. RESULTS: Interviews disclosed minimal awareness of ACTs among our pediatric CF patients. Subjects used games and control software a similar percentage of days during the game (26{\%}) and control periods (32{\%}). There was a trend toward more minutes with the game versus control setup (P = .07), though HFE count did not differ between the 2 conditions (P = .71). Game play showed no overall effect on FEV(1), though correlation analysis showed a modest relation between minutes of play and change in FEV(1) from baseline (r = 0.50, P = .09). The game period showed a trend to increased vital capacity (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Spirometer games elicit forced expiratory breath maneuvers in pediatric CF patients. Improvement in PFTs may be due to improved test performance technique, though improved obstructive/restrictive lung function due to game play cannot be excluded. A formal clinical trial of this approach is planned.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Treatment regimen for families of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) is considerable, particularly when nebulised therapies for chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway infection are prescribed. Adherence to these regimens is variable, particularly in adolescence. Previously, we reported children to be more adherent in evenings compared to mornings, suggesting an association with time-pressure. The aim of this study was to determine whether adherence would be better in adolescent patients at weekends and during school holidays when time-pressures may be less., STUDY DESIGN: 24 patients (14 male, median [range] age 13.9 [11.1-16.8] years) were enrolled from two regional paediatric CF centres in the United Kingdom. Data for a full scholastic year, were downloaded openly from a breath-activated data logging nebuliser (I-nebTM). Adherence ({\%} of doses taken/expected number) was calculated during term-times, holidays, weekends and weekdays, for each patient., RESULTS: Large variations in adherence were seen between patients. However, adherence during term-time was significantly better than holidays (p<0.001). Weekday adherence was better than weekend adherence in term-time but not holidays. Interestingly, patients prescribed three daily treatments took on average 1.4 treatments/day, a similar number to those prescribed two daily treatments., CONCLUSION: Overall adherence to inhaled therapies was reasonable, but significantly reduced during holiday periods. This suggests a need for families to have not only time, but also structure in their daily routine to maintain optimal adherence to long-term therapies. It is important for CF teams to appreciate these factors when supporting families.Copyright © 2013 European Cystic Fibrosis Society. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A small number of respondents (18{\%}) correctly identified the current recommendation to segregate patients with different organisms during airway clearance, with most respondents (73{\%}) implementing stricter infection control policies. Low levels of knowledge and agreement were evident for recommendations regarding measurement of blood sugar levels during exercise (36{\%} knowledge and 28{\%} agreement) and delivery of dornase alfa (53{\%} and 65{\%}). Physiotherapists from specialist CF centres were more likely to know the recommendations for blood sugar level measurement during exercise (P = 0.014), dornase alfa (P = 0.001) and non-invasive ventilation (P = 0.07) compared with physiotherapists in other settings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Physiotherapists are aware of treatment recommendations for CF in common areas of practice such as airway clearance and exercise. However, knowledge of recommendations is lower for specialized areas of practice and outside of CF centres. Strategies to improve awareness and uptake of the Consensus Statement among physiotherapists outside of CF centres are required.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6{\%} ± 24.0{\%} and 66.5{\%} ± 31.2{\%}, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6{\%} and 79.1{\%}, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7{\%} vs. 78.4{\%}, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite recognized benefits, many children with cystic fibrosis (CF) do not consistently participate in physical activities. There is little empirical literature regarding the feelings and attitudes of children with CF toward exercise programs, parental roles in exercise, or factors influencing exercise experiences during research participation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the exercise experiences of children with CF and their parents during participation in a 6-month program of self-regulated, home-based exercise.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This qualitative descriptive study was nested within a randomized controlled trial of a self-regulated, home-based exercise program and used serial semistructured interviews conducted individually at 2 and 6 months with 11 purposively selected children with CF and their parent(s).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Six boys and five girls, ages 10-16 years, and parents(nine mothers, four fathers) participated in a total of 44 interviews. Five major thematic categories describing child and parent perceptions and experience of the bicycle exercise program were identified in the transcripts: (a) motivators, (b) barriers, (c) effort/work, (d) exercise routine, and (e) sustaining exercise. Research participation, parent-family participation, health benefits, and the child's personality traits were the primary motivators. Competing activities, priorities, and responsibilities were the major barriers in implementing the exercise program as prescribed. Motivation waned, and the novelty wore off for several (approximately half) parent-child dyads, who planned to decrease or stop the exercise program after the study ended.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDISCUSSION: We identified motivators and barriers to a self-regulated, home-based exercise program for children with CF that can be addressed in planning future exercise interventions to maximize the health benefits for children with CF and the feasibility and acceptability to the children and their families.},

The effect of AVGs on acute energy expenditure (EE) has previously been reported; however, the influence of AVGs on other health-related lifestyle indicators remains unclear.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed to explain the relationship between AVGs and nine health and behavioural indicators in the pediatric population (aged 0-17 years).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, psycINFO, SPORTDiscus and Cochrane Central Database) and personal libraries were searched and content experts were consulted for additional material.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SELECTION: Included articles were required to have a measure of AVG and at least one relevant health or behaviour indicator: EE (both habitual and acute), adherence and appeal (i.e., participation and enjoyment), opportunity cost (both time and financial considerations, and adverse events), adiposity, cardiometabolic health, energy intake, adaptation (effects of continued play), learning and rehabilitation, and video game evolution (i.e., sustainability of AVG technology).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: 51 unique studies, represented in 52 articles were included in the review. Data were available from 1992 participants, aged 3-17 years, from 8 countries, and published from 2006-2012. Overall, AVGs are associated with acute increases in EE, but effects on habitual physical activity are not clear. Further, AVGs show promise when used for learning and rehabilitation within special populations. Evidence related to other indicators was limited and inconclusive.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Controlled studies show that AVGs acutely increase light- to moderate-intensity physical activity; however, the findings about if or how AVG lead to increases in habitual physical activity or decreases in sedentary behaviour are less clear. Although AVGs may elicit some health benefits in special populations, there is not sufficient evidence to recommend AVGs as a means of increasing daily physical activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Airway clearance therapy (ACT) is critical in cystic fibrosis (CF)., OBJECTIVES: To determine rates of self-reported adherence to ACT by patients treated in an adult CF program, to identify patient characteristics associated with poor adherence, to typify adherence according to ACT technique, and to indicate reasons for poor adherence., METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included CF subjects age 16 years and older. Enrollees were evaluated via general structured questionnaire, adherence questionnaire, clinical assessment, spirometry, and S(pO(2)) values. Each was stratified by self-reporting protocol as high, moderate, or poor adherence to ACT. Concordance between physiotherapist recommended ACT technique and self-reported subject adherence was subjected to agreement analysis., RESULTS: Of the 63 subjects studied, 38 (60{\%}) qualified as high adherence, 12 (19{\%}) as moderate adherence, and 13 (21{\%}) as poor adherence. Logistic regression identified education level (less than high school) as an independent factor associated with poor adherence (odds ratio 10.2, 95{\%} CI 1.23-84.7, P = .03). Positive expiratory pressure (kappa = 0.87) and flutter device (kappa = 0.63) usage both corresponded with a high level of agreement, while active cycle of breathing technique (kappa = 0.40) and autogenic drainage (kappa = 0.39) each showed moderate agreement. Agreement was low for percussion and postural drainage (kappa = 0.23). Reasons given most frequently for poor adherence to ACT were "not enough time to do ACT" (28{\%}), "cannot be bothered" (16{\%}), and "do not enjoy ACT technique" (8{\%}). Many (32{\%}) provided no reason., CONCLUSIONS: Study outcomes showed a high rate of ACT adherence in adult CF subjects. Lower level of education was the most important factor in poor adherence to ACT. Self-reported adherence and treatment recommendations were in best agreement with positive expiratory pressure and flutter device techniques.Copyright © 2013 Daedalus Enterprises.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50{\%} of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

Using one such device, we have monitored nebulised antibiotic adherence in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Methods: In CF children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, downloaded data from an AAD device was used to calculate morning, evening and overall monthly adherence to antibiotic therapy over a year. Results: Overall monthly adherence to nebulised antibiotic therapy in 28 children was maintained between 60 and 70{\%} over the year. Considerable variation in adherence, both between and within patients, was evident (Mean [SD] coefficient of variation, 37[44]{\%}). Evening adherence (75[37]{\%}) was better than morning adherence (58[34]{\%}: p = 0.012). Treatment regimens were changed in 8/28 patients based on adherence data. Conclusions: Routine adherence monitoring can be implemented in an outpatient setting. Using this type of information it is possible to identify which aspects of treatment can be improved and to work together with families to individualise treatments. ?? 2009 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6{\%}; moderate/large problem: 21.9{\%}), eating (32.4{\%}) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4{\%}). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3{\%}), anxiety (16.4{\%}) and stress (34.2{\%}). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95{\%} CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},

abstract = {Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a multisystemic disease characterized by an abnormal ventilation response that limiting the exercise tolerance. Current evidence shows that physical training increases exercise capacity, decreases disnea and improves quality of life in patients with CF. Adherence to respiratory rehabilitation programs is a key factor to guarantee optimal benefits. Our goal was to determine the efficiency of three Nintendo Wii video game as training systems by measuring the physiologic response of performing different exercises with CF patients. Method: we included 24CF patients [mean+SD: age: 12+3.7 years; BMI: 18+3; FVC: 97+20{\%}; FEV1:93+20{\%}] followed 4 different exercise types in randomized order during six minutes: (1) 6-min walking test (6MWT); (2) Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii-Fit); (3) Nintendo Wii Active (Wii-Acti), and (4) Nintendo Wii Family Trainner (Wii-Train). All physiologic responses were recorded breath by breath by using a portable gas analyzer (Fitmate Pro, Cosmed, Italy). Results: In all video game exercises, after the 3th minute, all physiological variables describe a plateau profile that remains stable until the end of the test, similar to the 6MWT. The Wii-Acti and Wii-Train obtained high and significative values compared with the 6MWT. Conclusion: From a physiological perspective, exercises executed with video game platforms are feasible and allow high intensity time-sustained exercise. This type of training could be recommended to the patients CF and can induce important physiologic improvements when used as a training method.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and mean oscillated volume (V(osc)) during high frequency chest compression (HFCC). DESIGN: A clinic-based prospective intervention study. SETTING: Pulmonary function laboratory, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta. POPULATION: Nine children with cystic fibrosis with little or no obstructive airway disease who were selected from the outpatient Cystic Fibrosis and Pediatric Pulmonary Clinics at the University of Alberta Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta. METHODS: Each child received HFCC alone (at 10 Hz with chest wall pressure of 8 cm H2O) and HFCC plus PEEP. A closed circuit spirometry system was used to measure HFCC- and PEEP-induced changes in EELV, expressed as per cent baseline functional residual capacity (FRC) measured using helium dilution. An isothermic chamber permitted measurement of V(osc). RESULTS: HFCC caused a significant 9{\%} decrease in EELV. Adding 2.0 +/- 0.3 cm H2O of PEEP increased EELV back to at least the FRC level. With HFCC alone, Vosc was significantly lower during spontaneous expiration than during spontaneous inspiration, but adding PEEP to HFCC increased V(osc), especially during spontaneous expiration. CONCLUSIONS: Adding PEEP during HFCC prevents the decrease in EELV and increases V(osc). Therefore, PEEP may improve HFCC-induced mucus clearance in children with cystic fibrosis.},

However, the compliance by young children and adolescents to undertake such physiotherapy can lead to confrontation and stressful situations within families, and can impact on the health of the individual. We have developed game software which is controlled through breathing into a PEP mask or mouthpiece using an air pressure sensor to interface with the PC. By combining games with mucus clearing devices, it could provide a powerful means of encouraging children, teenagers and adults to engage more frequently, and effectively, with vital mucus clearance physiotherapy.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment adherence is crucial in patients with cystic fibrosis, but poor adherence is a problem, especially during adolescence. Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60{\%} of the patients and by 62{\%} of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},

abstract = {Health game research has flourished over the last decade. The number of peer-reviewed scientific publications has surged as the clinical application of health games has diversified. In response to this growth, several past literature reviews have assessed the effectiveness of health games in specific clinical subdomains. The past literature reviews, however, have not provided a general scope of health games independent of clinical context. The present systematic review identified 149 publications. All sources were published before 2011 in a peer- reviewed venue. To be included in this review, publications were required (1) to be an original research, (2) to focus on health, (3) to utilize a sound research design, (4) to report quantitative health outcomes, and (5) to target healthcare receivers. Initial findings showed certain trends in health game publications: Focus on younger male demographics, relatively low number of study participants, increased number of controlled trials, short duration of intervention periods, short duration and frequency of user–game interaction, dominance of exercise and rehab games, lack of underlying theoretical frameworks, and concentration on clinical contexts such as physical activity and nutrition. The review concludes that future research should (1) widen the demographics to include females and elderly, (2) increase the number of participants in controlled trials, (3) lengthen both the intervention period and user–game interaction duration, and (4) expand the application of health games in new clinical contexts.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nebuliser systems are used to deliver medications to control the symptoms and the progression of lung disease in people with cystic fibrosis. Many types of nebuliser systems are available for use with various medications; however, there has been no previous systematic review which has evaluated these systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate effectiveness, safety, burden of treatment and adherence to nebulised therapy using different nebuliser systems for people with cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearching of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. We searched the reference lists of each study for additional publications and approached the manufacturers of both nebuliser systems and nebulised medications for published and unpublished data. Date of the most recent search: 15 Oct 2012.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing nebuliser systems including conventional nebulisers, vibrating mesh technology systems, adaptive aerosol delivery systems and ultrasonic nebuliser systems.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. They also independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. A third author assessed studies where agreement could not be reached.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMAIN RESULTS: The search identified 40 studies with 20 of these (1936 participants) included in the review. These studies compared the delivery of tobramycin, colistin, dornase alfa, hypertonic sodium chloride and other solutions through the different nebuliser systems. This review demonstrates variability in the delivery of medication depending on the nebuliser system used. Conventional nebuliser systems providing higher flows, higher respirable fractions and smaller particles decrease treatment time, increase deposition and may be preferred by people with CF, as compared to conventional nebuliser systems providing lower flows, lower respirable fractions and larger particles. Nebulisers using adaptive aerosol delivery or vibrating mesh technology reduce treatment time to a far greater extent. Deposition (as a percentage of priming dose) is greater than conventional with adaptive aerosol delivery. Vibrating mesh technology systems may give greater deposition than conventional when measuring sputum levels, but lower deposition when measuring serum levels or using gamma scintigraphy. The available data indicate that these newer systems are safe when used with an appropriate priming dose, which may be different to the priming dose used for conventional systems. There is an indication that adherence is maintained or improved with systems which use these newer technologies, but also that some nebuliser systems using vibrating mesh technology may be subject to increased failures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware of the variability in the performance of different nebuliser systems. Technologies such as adaptive aerosol delivery and vibrating mesh technology have advantages over conventional systems in terms of treatment time, deposition as a percentage of priming dose, patient preference and adherence. There is a need for long-term randomised controlled trials of these technologies to determine patient-focused outcomes (such as quality of life and burden of care), safe and effective dosing levels of medications and clinical outcomes (such as hospitalisations and need for antibiotics) and an economic evaluation of their use.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) have large amounts of infected mucus in their lungs, which causes irreversible lung tissue damage. Although patient-administered positive expiratory pressure (PEP) breathing has been promoted as an effective therapeutic modality for removing mucus and improving ventilation distribution in these patients, the effects of PEP on ventilation distribution and gas mixing have not been documented. Therefore, this preliminary investigation described responses in distribution of ventilation and gas mixing to PEP breathing for patients with moderate to severe CF lung disease. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The effects of PEP breathing on ventilation distribution, gas mixing, lung volumes, expiratory airflow, percentage of arterial blood oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), and sputum volume were studied in 5 patients with CF (mean age=18 years, SD=4, range=13-22) after no-PEP, low-PEP (10-20 cm H(2)O), and high-PEP (>20 cm H(2)O) breathing conditions. Single-breath inert gas studies and lung function tests were performed before, immediately after, and 45 minutes after intervention. Single-breath tests assess ventilation distribution homogeneity and gas mixing by observing the extent to which an inspired test gas mixes with gas already residing in the lung. RESULTS: Improvements in gas mixing were observed in all PEP conditions. By 45 minutes after intervention, the no-PEP group improved by 5{\%}, the low-PEP group improved by 15{\%}, and the high-PEP group improved by 23{\%}. Slow vital capacity increased by 1{\%} for no PEP, by 9{\%} for low PEP, and by 13{\%} for high PEP 45 minutes after intervention. Residual volume decreased by 13{\%} after no PEP, by 20{\%} after low PEP, and by 30{\%} after high PEP. Immediate improvements in forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity maneuver (FEF(25{\%}-75{\%})) were sustained following high PEP but not following low PEP. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated the physiologic basis for the efficacy of PEP therapy. The results confirm that low PEP and high PEP improve gas mixing in individuals with CF, and these improvements were associated with increased lung function, sputum expectoration, and SpO(2). The authors propose that improvements in gas mixing may lead to increases in oxygenation and thus functional exercise capacity.},

abstract = {REVIEW DATE: 1969 to 2003, 34 years. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT: Simulations are now in widespread use in medical education and medical personnel evaluation. Outcomes research on the use and effectiveness of simulation technology in medical education is scattered, inconsistent and varies widely in methodological rigor and substantive focus. OBJECTIVES: Review and synthesize existing evidence in educational science that addresses the question, 'What are the features and uses of high-fidelity medical simulations that lead to most effective learning?'. SEARCH STRATEGY: The search covered five literature databases (ERIC, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and Timelit) and employed 91 single search terms and concepts and their Boolean combinations. Hand searching, Internet searches and attention to the 'grey literature' were also used. The aim was to perform the most thorough literature search possible of peer-reviewed publications and reports in the unpublished literature that have been judged for academic quality. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Four screening criteria were used to reduce the initial pool of 670 journal articles to a focused set of 109 studies: (a) elimination of review articles in favor of empirical studies; (b) use of a simulator as an educational assessment or intervention with learner outcomes measured quantitatively; (c) comparative research, either experimental or quasi-experimental; and (d) research that involves simulation as an educational intervention. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted systematically from the 109 eligible journal articles by independent coders. Each coder used a standardized data extraction protocol. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative data synthesis and tabular presentation of research methods and outcomes were used. Heterogeneity of research designs, educational interventions, outcome measures and timeframe precluded data synthesis using meta-analysis. HEADLINE RESULTS: Coding accuracy for features of the journal articles is high. The extant quality of the published research is generally weak. The weight of the best available evidence suggests that high-fidelity medical simulations facilitate learning under the right conditions. These include the following: providing feedback--51 (47{\%}) journal articles reported that educational feedback is the most important feature of simulation-based medical education; repetitive practice--43 (39{\%}) journal articles identified repetitive practice as a key feature involving the use of high-fidelity simulations in medical education; curriculum integration--27 (25{\%}) journal articles cited integration of simulation-based exercises into the standard medical school or postgraduate educational curriculum as an essential feature of their effective use; range of difficulty level--15 (14{\%}) journal articles address the importance of the range of task difficulty level as an important variable in simulation-based medical education; multiple learning strategies--11 (10{\%}) journal articles identified the adaptability of high-fidelity simulations to multiple learning strategies as an important factor in their educational effectiveness; capture clinical variation--11 (10{\%}) journal articles cited simulators that capture a wide variety of clinical conditions as more useful than those with a narrow range; controlled environment--10 (9{\%}) journal articles emphasized the importance of using high-fidelity simulations in a controlled environment where learners can make, detect and correct errors without adverse consequences; individualized learning--10 (9{\%}) journal articles highlighted the importance of having reproducible, standardized educational experiences where learners are active participants, not passive bystanders; defined outcomes--seven (6{\%}) journal articles cited the importance of having clearly stated goals with tangible outcome measures that will more likely lead to learners mastering skills; simulator validity--four (3{\%}) journal articles provided evidence for the direct correlation of simulation validity with effective learning. CONCLUSIONS: While research in this field needs improvement in terms of rigor and quality, high-fidelity medical simulations are educationally effective and simulation-based education complements medical education in patient care settings.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how medical specialists view health technology assessment (HTA) and its role in policy-making. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews with 28 medical specialists practising in Quebec and Ontario (Canada) to examine their views on an HTA report relevant to their specialty (prostate-specific antigen screening, electroconvulsive therapy and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome). RESULTS: Medical specialists represent a particularly demanding audience for HTA producers because they are knowledgeable about current studies in their field and often contribute to the evidence base that HTA seeks to synthesize. In all three cases, specialists not only challenged specific points in the content of the HTA reports but also offered different and sometimes conflicting appraisals of the clinical relevance and policy implications. More than just the timeliness and usefulness of HTA findings are at issue. The views of specialists are grounded in a clinical understanding of what counts as evidence and how decisions should be made, a view that contrasts with the societal perspective of HTA. CONCLUSIONS: HTA producers cannot afford to overlook medical specialists who play a key role in the adoption of health technologies. Establishing a transparent dialogue between producers and users of HTA reports could enrich policy recommendations.},

abstract = {The course of cystic fibrosis (CF) progression in children is affected by parent adherence to treatment plans. The Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) posits that intentions are the best behavioral predictors and that intentions reasonably follow from beliefs ("determinants"). Determinants are affected by multiple "background factors," including spirituality. This study's purpose was to understand whether two parental adherence determinants (attitude towards treatment and self-efficacy) were associated with spirituality (religious coping and sanctification of the body). We hypothesized that parents' attitudes toward treatment adherence are associated with these spiritual constructs. A convenience sample of parents of children with CF aged 3-12 years (n=28) participated by completing surveys of adherence and spirituality during a regular outpatient clinic visit. Type and degree of religious coping was examined using principal component analysis. Adherence measures were compared based on religious coping styles and sanctification of the body using unpaired t-tests. Collaborative religious coping was associated with higher self-efficacy for completing airway clearance (M=1070.8; SD=35.8; P=0.012), for completing aerosolized medication administration (M=1077.1; SD=37.4; P=0.018), and for attitude towards treatment utility (M=38.8; SD=2.36; P=0.038). Parents who attributed sacred qualities to their child's body (e.g., "blessed" or "miraculous") had higher mean scores for self-efficacy (airway clearance, M=1058.6; SD=37.7; P=0.023; aerosols M=1070.8; SD=41.6; P=0.020). Parents for whom God was manifested in their child's body (e.g., "My child's body is created in God's image") had higher mean scores for self-efficacy for airway clearance (M=1056.4; SD=59.0; P=0.039), aerosolized medications (M=1068.8; SD=42.6; P=0.033) and treatment utility (M=38.8; SD=2.4; P=0.025). Spiritual constructs show promising significance and are currently undervalued in chronic disease management.Copyright © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This essay critically explores the role of technological innovation in the constitution of chronic states and illness. Drawing on the co-construction of technology and society perspective, it focuses more specifically on the way in which innovation designers envisage the enhancement of the chronically ill and build certain kinds of socio-technical configuration to deal with chronic illness. Using the case of ;intelligent distance patient monitoring' as an illustration, the paper argues that technology creates as much as it solves the problem of chronic illness. Technology is recursively embedded in chronic illness and it generates dual effects: it constrains and sustains users' daily practices. Only by recognizing technology's duality and eventually transcending it will research and policy initiatives be able to deal creatively and responsibly with the design of our future health experiences.},

abstract = {Background: Cystic fi brosis patients require daily airway clear- ance therapies. The primary objective of this study was to compare the short-term effi cacy of high-frequency chest compression and positive expiratory pressure mask on expectorated sputum, pulmo- nary function, and oxygen saturation in patients with CF hospital- ized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation. Methods: A controlled randomized cross-over trial with 24 hours between treatments was used. Thirty-four CF patients (26 ± 6.5 years) were included in the study. Before and 30 minutes after each treatment were recorded: pulmonary function testing, oxygen satu- ration, and perceived dyspnea. Preference for the two devices was assessed. Results: No statistically signifi cant difference between high-fre- quency chest compression and positive expiratory pressure mask was found in sputum production and in lung function testing. A re- duction in SpO2 was found after positive expiratory pressure mask (98 ± 1.0{\%} versus 97 ± 1.2{\%}; P < 0.001). Both treatments induced a statistically signifi cant increase in Borg scale for dyspnea with- out differences between them. Patients reported greater satisfaction with positive expiratory pressure mask than with high-frequency chest compression (P < 0.001). Conclusions: High-frequency chest compression and positive ex- piratory pressure mask have comparable short-term effects on ex-pectorated sputum and lung function. Although positive expiratory pressure mask was associated with a lower SpO2 , it was better toler- ated than high-frequency chest compression.},

abstract = {Over the past 15 years, the use of specialised medical equipment by patients at home has increased in most industrialised countries. Adopting a conceptual framework that brings together two research perspectives, i.e. the sociology of technology and the sociology of illness, this paper empirically examines why and how patients use health technology at home and in the broader social world. Our study compares and contrasts the use of four interventions: antibiotic intravenous therapy, parenteral nutrition, peritoneal dialysis and oxygen therapy. We conducted interviews with patients (n = 16) and caregivers (n = 6), and made direct observations of home visits by nurses (n = 16). The content and structure of patient manuals distributed by major manufacturers and hospitals were analysed (n = 26). The aim of our study was to determine how technology was supposed to be used versus how it was actually used. This study shows that patients are deeply ambivalent about the benefits and drawbacks of technology, and that these advantages and disadvantages are shaped by the various places in which the technology is used. While technology can be pivotal in making patients autonomous and able to participate in the social world, it also imposes heavy restrictions that are intimately interwoven with the nature of the particular disease and with the patient's personal life trajectory.},

We review current research on the effect of action video game training on visual attention and visuospatial processing, executive functions, and learning and memory. Focusing on studies that utilize strict experimental controls and synthesize behavioral and neurophysiological data, we examine whether there is sufficient evidence to support a causal relationship between action video game training and beneficial changes in cognition. Convergent lines of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence tentatively support the efficacy of training, but the magnitude and specificity of these effects remain obscure. Causal inference is thus far limited by a lack of standardized and well-controlled methodology. Considering future directions, we suggest stringent adherence to evidence-based practices and collaboration modeled after clinical trial networks. Finally, we recommend the exploration of more complex causal models, such as indirect causal relationships and interactions that may be masking true effects.},

Prolonged bronchial obstruction, infection, and inflammation result in bronchiectstasis and permanent lung damage. Most cystic fibrosis patients die because of this progressive respiratory disease. Thus, in the absence of a cure, effective respiratory therapy is the primary means to extend and improve the quality of life for the cystic fibrosis patient. Aerosol therapy, airway clearance techniques, and noninvasive ventilation can all improve quality of life and possibly extend survival. Close patient monitoring with pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, and induced sputum can result in earlier treatment, potentially reducing permanent lung damage. Earlier diagnosis has prevented serious complications through early initiation of preventive therapies such as improved nutrition.},

abstract = {Question: Does exercise using a gaming console result in similar cardiovascular demand and energy expenditure as formally prescribed exercise in adults with cystic fibrosis? How do these patients perceive gaming console exercise? Design: Randomised cross-over trial with concealed allocation and intention-to-treat analysis. Participants: 19 adults with cystic fibrosis admitted to hospital for treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation. Intervention: Participants underwent two 15-minute exercise interventions on separate days; one involving a gaming console and one a treadmill or cycle ergometer. Outcome measures: Cardiovascular demand was measured using heart rate and rating of perceived exertion (RPE). Energy expenditure was estimated using a portable activity monitor. Perception (enjoyment, fatigue, workload, effectiveness, feasibility) was rated using a horizontal 10-cm visual analogue scale. Results: There was no significant difference in average heart rate (mean difference 3 beats/min, 95{\%} Cl -3 to 9) or energy expenditure (0.1 MET, 95{\%} Cl -0.3 to 0.5) between the two interventions. Both interventions provided a 'hard' workout (RPE {\~{}}15). Gaming console exercise was rated as more enjoyable (mean difference 2.6 cm, 95{\%} CI 1.6 to 3.6) than formal exercise but they didn't differ significantly in fatigue (-1.0 cm, 95{\%} CI -2.4 to 0.3), perceived effectiveness (-0.4 cm, 95{\%} CI -1.2 to 0.3), or perceived feasibility for inclusion in routine management (0.2 cm, 95{\%} CI -0.7 to 1.1). Conclusion: Gaming console exercise provides a similar cardiovascular demand as traditional exercise modalities.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Airway clearance therapy (ACT) is critical in cystic fibrosis (CF)., OBJECTIVES: To determine rates of self-reported adherence to ACT by patients treated in an adult CF program, to identify patient characteristics associated with poor adherence, to typify adherence according to ACT technique, and to indicate reasons for poor adherence., METHODS: Our cross-sectional study included CF subjects age 16 years and older. Enrollees were evaluated via general structured questionnaire, adherence questionnaire, clinical assessment, spirometry, and S(pO(2)) values. Each was stratified by self-reporting protocol as high, moderate, or poor adherence to ACT. Concordance between physiotherapist recommended ACT technique and self-reported subject adherence was subjected to agreement analysis., RESULTS: Of the 63 subjects studied, 38 (60{\%}) qualified as high adherence, 12 (19{\%}) as moderate adherence, and 13 (21{\%}) as poor adherence. Logistic regression identified education level (less than high school) as an independent factor associated with poor adherence (odds ratio 10.2, 95{\%} CI 1.23-84.7, P = .03). Positive expiratory pressure (kappa = 0.87) and flutter device (kappa = 0.63) usage both corresponded with a high level of agreement, while active cycle of breathing technique (kappa = 0.40) and autogenic drainage (kappa = 0.39) each showed moderate agreement. Agreement was low for percussion and postural drainage (kappa = 0.23). Reasons given most frequently for poor adherence to ACT were "not enough time to do ACT" (28{\%}), "cannot be bothered" (16{\%}), and "do not enjoy ACT technique" (8{\%}). Many (32{\%}) provided no reason., CONCLUSIONS: Study outcomes showed a high rate of ACT adherence in adult CF subjects. Lower level of education was the most important factor in poor adherence to ACT. Self-reported adherence and treatment recommendations were in best agreement with positive expiratory pressure and flutter device techniques.Copyright © 2013 Daedalus Enterprises.},

The OTS has therefore funded a three-year programme on measuring social value. The work began in November 2008 and is being delivered by a consortium of organisations: the SROI Network, nef (the new economics foundation), Charities Evaluation Services, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and New Philanthropy Capital. In addition to this programme, the Scottish Government is also supporting SROI, including the development of a database of indicators to support SROI analysis. This guide, which builds on the work in three earlier SROI guides1 , has been prepared as part of this programme. The purpose of this guide is to standardise practice, develop the methodology, and provide more clarity on the use of SROI. It has been written for people who want to measure and analyse the social, environmental and economic value being generated by their activities or by the activities they are funding or commissioning.},

Cystic fibrosis, one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults, causes mucus to build up in the lungs and digestive tract. To clear mucus from the airways, patients must do breathing exhalation maneuvers called "huffing" several times a day. Many children, however, refuse, preferring to play video games instead, according to Peter M. Bingham, MD, lead author of the study.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by dehydration of airway surface liquid and impaired mucociliary clearance. As a result, there is difficulty clearing pathogens from the lung, and patients experience chronic pulmonary infections and inflammation. Clearance of airway secretions has been a primary therapy for those with CF, and a variety of airway clearance therapies (ACTs) have been developed. Because ACTs are intrusive and require considerable time and effort, it is important that appropriate techniques are recommended on the basis of available evidence of efficacy and safety. Therefore, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation established a committee to examine the clinical evidence for each therapy and provide guidance for their use. A systematic review was commissioned, which identified 7 unique reviews and 13 additional controlled trials that addressed one or more of the comparisons of interest and were deemed eligible for inclusion. Recommendations for use of the ACTs were made, balancing the quality of evidence and the potential harms and benefits. The committee determined that, although there is a paucity of controlled trials that assess the long-term effects of ACTs, the evidence quality overall for their use in CF is fair and the benefit is moderate. The committee recommends airway clearance be performed on a regular basis in all patients. There are no ACTs demonstrated to be superior to others, so the prescription of ACTs should be individualized. Aerobic exercise is recommended as an adjunctive therapy for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health.},

abstract = {Background: Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50{\%}. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50{\%} for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27{\%} to 46{\%}. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

In this paper, we discuss adaptive tech- niques for providing real-time haptic and visual feedback during a virtual bone dissection simulation. The simulator is being developed as a component of a training system for temporal bone surgery. We harness the difference in com- plexity and frequency requirements of the visual and hap- tic simulations by modeling the system as a collection of loosely coupled concurrent components. The haptic com- ponent exploits a multi-resolution representation of the first two moments of the bone characteristic function to rapidly compute contact forces and determine bone erosion. The visual component uses a time-critical particle system evo- lution method to simulate secondary visual effects, such as bone debris accumulation, blooding, irrigation, and suc- tion.},

They offer a unified model for looking at all kinds of games, from board games and sports to computer and video games. As active participants in game culture, the authors have written Rules of Play as a catalyst for innovation, filled with new concepts, strategies, and methodologies for creating and understanding games..Building an aesthetics of interactive systems, Salen and Zimmerman define core concepts like "play," "design," and "interactivity." They look at games through a series of eighteen "game design schemas," or conceptual frameworks, including games as systems of emergence and information, as contexts for social play, as a storytelling medium, and as sites of cultural resistance.Written for game scholars, game developers, and interactive designers, Rules of Play is a textbook, reference book, and theoretical guide. It is the first comprehensive attempt to establish a solid theoretical framework for the emerging discipline of game design.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Of all stroke survivors, 30{\%} to 66{\%} are unable to use their affected arm in performing activities of daily living. Although forced use therapy appears to improve arm function in chronic stroke patients, there is no conclusive evidence. This study evaluates the effectiveness of forced use therapy. METHODS: In an observer-blinded randomized clinical trial, 66 chronic stroke patients were allocated to either forced use therapy (immobilization of the unaffected arm combined with intensive training) or a reference therapy of equally intensive bimanual training, based on Neuro-Developmental Treatment, for a period of 2 weeks. Outcomes were evaluated on the basis of the Rehabilitation Activities Profile (activities), the Action Research Arm (ARA) test (dexterity), the upper extremity section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment scale, the Motor Activity Log (MAL), and a Problem Score. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was determined at the onset of the study. RESULTS: One week after the last treatment session, a significant difference in effectiveness in favor of the forced use group compared with the bimanual group (corrected for baseline differences) was found for the ARA score (3.0 points; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 4.8; MCID, 5.7 points) and the MAL amount of use score (0.52 points; 95{\%} CI, 0.11 to 0.93; MCID, 0.50). The other parameters revealed no significant differential effects. One-year follow-up effects were observed only for the ARA. The differences in treatment effect for the ARA and the MAL amount of use scores were clinically relevant for patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed a small but lasting effect of forced use therapy on the dexterity of the affected arm (ARA) and a temporary clinically relevant effect on the amount of use of the affected arm during activities of daily living (MAL amount of use). The effect of forced use therapy was clinically relevant in the subgroups of patients with sensory disorders and hemineglect, respectively.},

abstract = {Stroke is the main cause of disabilities in the world and is typically treated with intensive, hands-on physical and occupational therapy for several weeks after the initial injury. However, due to economic pressures, stroke patients are receiving less therapy and going home sooner, so the potential benefit of the therapy is not completely realized. Thus, it is important to develop rehabilitation technology that allows individuals who had suffered a stroke to practice intensive movement training without the expense of an always-present therapist. Although several robotic devices have been developed for stroke rehabilitation, these are too expensive for use at home or in small clinics.We have developed a low-cost alternative that allows stroke survivors to practice arm movement exercises at home or at the clinic, with periodic interactions with a therapist. The system integrates a virtual environment for facilitating repetitive movement training, with computer vision algorithms that track the hand of a patient, using an inexpensive camera and a conventional personal computer. This system, called Gesture Therapy, has been evaluated in a controlled clinical trial at a hospital in Mexico City, comparing it with conventional occupational therapy. The results show that both treatments improve the functionality of the affected upper extremity, with not significant difference between them. However, the patients that used the virtual environment have a greater motivation and attachment to the treatment, which in the long term are decisive for maximal recovery.},

abstract = {This article presents a modular approach to incorporate multi-modal – gesture and speech – driven interaction into virtual reality systems. Based on existing techniques for modelling VR- applications, the overall task is separated into different problem categories: from sensor synchronisation to a high-level description of cross-modal temporal and semantic coherences , a set of solution concepts is presented that seamlessly fit into both the static (scenegraph- based) representation and into the dynamic (render-loop and immersion) aspects of a real- time application. The developed framework establishes a connecting layer between raw sensor data and a general functional description of multi-modal and scene-context related evaluation procedures for VR-setups. As an example for the concepts usefulness, their implementation in a system for virtual construction is described. Introduction},

@article{Staubli_EffectsIntensiveArmTraining,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Robot-assisted therapy offers a promising approach to neurorehabilitation, particularly for severely to moderately impaired stroke patients. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of intensive arm training on motor performance in four chronic stroke patients using the robot ARMin II. METHODS: ARMin II is an exoskeleton robot with six degrees of freedom (DOF) moving shoulder, elbow and wrist joints. Four volunteers with chronic (>or= 12 months post-stroke) left side hemi-paresis and different levels of motor severity were enrolled in the study. They received robot-assisted therapy over a period of eight weeks, three to four therapy sessions per week, each session of one hour.Patients 1 and 4 had four one-hour training sessions per week and patients 2 and 3 had three one-hour training sessions per week. Primary outcome variable was the Fugl-Meyer Score of the upper extremity Assessment (FMA), secondary outcomes were the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the Catherine Bergego Scale (CBS), the Maximal Voluntary Torques (MVTs) and a questionnaire about ADL-tasks, progress, changes, motivation etc. RESULTS: Three out of four patients showed significant improvements (p < 0.05) in the main outcome. The improvements in the FMA scores were aligned with the objective results of MVTs. Most improvements were maintained or even increased from discharge to the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Data clearly indicate that intensive arm therapy with the robot ARMin II can significantly improve motor function of the paretic arm in some stroke patients, even those in a chronic state. The findings of the study provide a basis for a subsequent controlled randomized clinical trial.},

The system contains a series of Virtual Reality (VR) games. A framework for VR movement therapy is described which consists of a number of serious games designed to encourage patients' physical activity in highly motivating, virtual environments where various factors such as size and gravity can be scaled to adapt to individual patient's abilities and in-game performance. Another goal of this study is to determine whether the provision of serious games based interventions improves motor outcome after stroke. A pilot study with 8 participants who have a first hemispheric stroke shows improvements on impairment measurement and functional measurement shortly after completion of the intervention and 6 weeks after the intervention. Despite its limitations the findings of this study support the effectiveness of serious games in the treatment of participants with hemiplegia. The study also raises awareness of the benefits of using serious games in movement therapy after stroke.},

The simulator is being developed as a component of a training system for temporal bone surgery. We harness the difference in com- plexity and frequency requirements of the visual and hap- tic simulations by modeling the system as a collection of loosely coupled concurrent components. The haptic com- ponent exploits a multi-resolution representation of the first two moments of the bone characteristic function to rapidly compute contact forces and determine bone erosion.

@article{MeriansSensorimotorTraining,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of computerized virtual reality (VR) training of the hemiparetic hand of patients poststroke using a system that provides repetitive motor reeducation and skill reacquisition. METHODS: Eight subjects in the chronic phase poststroke participated in a 3-week program using their hemiparetic hand in a series of interactive computer games for 13 days of training, weekend breaks, and pretests and posttests. Each subject trained for about 2 to 2.5 h per day. Outcome measures consisted of changes in the computerized measures of thumb and finger range of motion, thumb and finger velocity, fractionation (the ability to move fingers independently), thumb and finger strength, the Jebsen Test of Hand Function, and a Kinematic reach to grasp test. RESULTS: Subjects as a group improved in fractionation of the fingers, thumb and finger range of motion, and thumb and finger speed, retaining those gains at the 1-week retention test. Transfer of these improvements was demonstrated through changes in the Jebsen Test of Hand Function and a decrease after the therapy in the overall time from hand peak velocity to the moment when an object was lifted from the table. CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult in current service delivery models to provide the intensity of practice that appears to be needed to effect neural reorganization and functional changes poststroke. Computerized exercise systems may be a way to maximize both the patients' and the clinicians' time. The data in this study add support to the proposal to explore novel technologies for incorporation into current practice.},

Compared to end-effector-based robots, exoskeleton robots provide improved guidance of the human limb and are better suited to train task-oriented movements with a large range of motions. OBJECTIVE: To test whether intensive arm training with the arm exoskeleton ARMin I is feasible with chronic-stroke patients and whether it improves motor function in the paretic arm. METHODS: Three single cases with chronic hemiparesis resulting from unilateral stroke (at least 14 months after stroke). A-B design with 2 weeks of multiple baseline measurements (A), 8 weeks of training (B) with repetitive measurements and a follow-up measurement 8 weeks after training. The training included shoulder and elbow movements with the robotic rehabilitation device ARMin I. Two subjects had three 1-hour sessions per week and 1 subject received five 1-hour sessions per week. The main outcome measurement was the upper-limb part of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA). RESULTS: The ARMin training was well tolerated by the patients, and the FMA showed moderate, but significant improvements for all 3 subjects (p < 0.05). Most improvements were maintained 8 weeks after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that intensive training with an arm exoskeleton is feasible with chronic-stroke patients. Moderate improvements were found in all 3 subjects, thus further clinical investigations are justified.},

@article{Nagle_PlayerCenteredRewardScheduling,
abstract = {Among the methods used to increase enjoyment and performance in serious games, reward schedules, i.e., determining when in-game rewards should be given, have not been sufficiently explored. In the present study, we designed a simple memory training serious game and compared two methods of scheduling rewards, both based on the paradigm of positive reinforcement: fixed ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after a fixed number of correct responses, and variable ratio schedule, in which rewards were given after an unpredictable number of correct responses. To account for the variability in player preference for rewards, a player-centered sub-mode was included in both schedules by adjusting the schedule ratio according to player preference for rewards. The effectiveness of this approach was tested by comparing it against two more sub-modes: one which used a predetermined ratio, and another which set the ratio to the opposite of player preference. The game was put online and tested with 210 participants. Enjoyment, performance, duration of gameplay, and likelihood to play again were significantly higher in the player-centered sub-mode than the other sub-modes. On average, the variable-ratio schedule was better in the outcome measures than the fixed-ratio schedule. The results highlight the importance of in-game rewards, and indicate that giving rewards according to a player-centered variable-ratio schedule has the potential to make serious games more effective.},

@article{Alankus_TowardsCustomizableGames,
abstract = {Stroke is the leading cause of long term disability among adults in industrialized nations. The partial paralysis that stroke patients often experience can make independent living difficult or impossible. Research suggests that many of these patients could recover by performing hundreds of daily repetitions of motions with their affected limbs. Yet, only 31{\%} of patients perform the exercises recommended by their therapists. Home-based stroke rehabilitation games may help motivate stroke patients to perform the necessary exercises to recover. In this paper, we describe a formative study in which we designed and user tested stroke rehabilitation games with both stroke patients and therapists. We describe the lessons we learned about what makes games useful from a therapeutic point of view.},

@article{Kim_KinematicDataWearableRobot,
abstract = {Robot-assisted stroke rehabilitation has become popular as one approach to helping patients recover function post-stroke. Robotic rehabilitation requires four important elements to match the robot to the patient: realistic biomechanical robotic elements, an assistive control scheme enabled through the human-robot interface, a task oriented rehabilitation program based on the principles of plasticity, and objective assessment tools to monitor change. This paper reports on a randomized clinical trial utilizing a complete robot-assisted rehabilitation system for the recovery of upper limb function in patients post-stroke. In this study, a seven degree-of-freedom (DOF) upper limb exoskeleton robot (UL-EXO7) is applied in a rehabilitation clinical trial for patients stable post-stroke (greater than six months). Patients had a Fugl-Meyer Score between 16-39, were mentally alert (> 19 on the VA Mini Mental Status Exam) and were between 27 and 70 years of age. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups: bilateral robotic training, unilateral robotic training, and usual care. This study is concerned with the changes in kinematics in the two robotic groups. Both patient groups played eight therapeutic video games over 12 sessions (90 min, two times a week). In each session, patients intensively played the different combination of video games that directly interacted with UL-EXO7 under the supervision of research assistant. At each session, all of the joint angle data was recorded for the evaluation of therapeutic effects. A new assessment metric is reported along with conventional metrics. The experimental result shows that both groups of patients showed consistent improvement with respect to the proposed and conventional metrics.},

Robotic-assisted arm training devices integrated with virtual targets or complex virtual reality gaming simulations are being developed to deal with this problem. Neural control mechanisms indicate that reaching and hand-object manipulation are interdependent, suggesting that training on tasks requiring coordinated effort of both the upper arm and hand may be a more effective method for improving recovery of real world function. However, most robotic therapies have focused on training the proximal, rather than distal effectors of the upper extremity. This paper describes the effects of robotically-assisted, integrated upper extremity training.},

@article{Bermudez_NTT,
abstract = {After stroke, enduring rehabilitation is required for maximum recovery, and ideally throughout life to prevent functional deterioration. Hence we developed a new concept for at-home low-cost motor rehabilitation, the NTT, an Internet-based interactive system for upper-limb rehabilitation. In this paper we present the NTT design concepts, its implementation and a proof of concept study with 10 healthy participants. The NTT brings together concepts of optimal learning, engagement, and storytelling to deliver a personalized training to its users. In this study we evaluate the feasibility of NTT as a tool capable of automatically assessing and adapting to its user. This is achieved by means of a psychometric study where we show that the NTT is able to assess movement kinematics-movement smoothness, range of motion, arm displacement and arm coordination-in healthy users. Subsequently, a modeling approach is presented to understand how the measured movement kinematics relate to training parameters, and how these can be modified to adapt the training to meet the needs of patients. Finally, an adaptive algorithm for the personalization of training considering motivational and performance aspects is proposed. In the next phase we will deploy and evaluate the NTT with stroke patients at their homes.},

@article{Cochrane_Intervention4MotorApraxia,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Apraxia is a cognitive disorder that can occur after stroke. It prevents a person from carrying out a learned movement. Various interventions are used to treat apraxia but evidence of their benefit has been lacking. OBJECTIVES: To determine which therapeutic interventions targeted at motor apraxia reduce disability. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched November 2006). In addition, we searched the following databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to November 2007), EMBASE (1980 to November 2006), CINAHL (1982 to November 2006), PsycINFO (1974 to November 2006), the Research Index of the Occupational Therapy Journal (searched November 2006), REHABDATA (1956 to November 2006), the National Research Register (searched November 2006) and Current Controlled Trials Register (searched November 2006). We reviewed the reference lists of all articles that we identified as relevant. We made efforts to find both published and unpublished trials by writing to key authors and journals. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of therapeutic intervention for motor apraxia in stroke. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One review author searched the titles, abstracts and keywords. Four review authors extracted data and analysed trial quality. We contacted investigators for further details of trials if necessary. MAIN RESULTS: Three trials including a total of 132 participants were included in the review. There was evidence of a small and short-lived therapeutic effect in the two studies that reported change in activities of daily living (102 participants) but this was not considered clinically significant and did not persist at the longer-term follow up. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of specific therapeutic interventions for motor apraxia after stroke. Further research of higher quality is required. As we did not review whether patients with apraxia benefit from rehabilitation input in general, they should continue to receive general stroke rehabilitation services.},

abstract = {A VR-based system using a CyberGlove and a Rutgers Master II-ND haptic glove was used to rehabilitate four post-stroke patients in the chronic phase. Each patient had to perform a variety of VR exercises to reduce impairments in their finger range of motion, speed, fractionation and strength. Patients exercised for about two hours per day, five days a week for three weeks. Results showed that three of the patients had gains in thumb range (50-140{\%}) and finger speed (10-15{\%}) over the three weeks trial. All four patients had significant improvement in finger fractionation (40-118{\%}). Gains in finger strength were modest, due in part to an unexpected hardware malfunction. Two of the patients were measured against one-month post intervention and showed good retention. Evaluation using the Jebsen Test of Hand Function showed a reduction of 23-28{\%} in time completion for two of the patients (the ones with the higher degrees of impairment). A prehension task was performed 9-40{\%} faster for three of the patients after the intervention illustrating transfer of their improvement to a functional task.},

There is evidence that the training duration is a key factor for the therapy progress. Robot-supported therapy can improve the rehabilitation allowing more intensive training. This paper presents the kinematics, the control and the therapy modes of the arm therapy robot ARMin. It is a haptic display with semi-exoskeleton kinematics with four active and two passive degrees of freedom. Equipped with position, force and torque sensors the device can deliver patient-cooperative arm therapy taking into account the activity of the patient and supporting him/her only as much as needed. The haptic display is combined with an audiovisual display that is used to present the movement and the movement task to the patient. It is assumed that the patient-cooperative therapy approach combined with a multimodal display can increase the patient's motivation and activity and, therefore, the therapeutic progress.},
