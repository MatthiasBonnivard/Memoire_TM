abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between observations of the quality of family relationships and problem-solving skills and reported adherence to medical treatments for older children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF). METHODS: Reports of adherence were obtained from 96 youth with CF and their parents recruited from six CF centers in the Midwest and southeastern United States. Videotaped observations of family discussions of high conflict issues were used to assess quality of relationships and problem-solving skills. RESULTS: Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that observed family relationship quality (RQ) was related to parent and child reports of adherence to airway clearance and aerosolized medications after controlling for demographic variables and illness severity. Observed family problem solving was not a significant predictor after controlling for RQ. CONCLUSIONS: Older children and adolescents who come from families experiencing unhappy and conflicted relationships may be at greater risk for poor adherence to treatments; thus, family relationships are appropriate targets for interventions aimed at improving adherence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment adherence is crucial in patients with cystic fibrosis, but poor adherence is a problem, especially during adolescence. Identification of barriers to treatment adherence and a better understanding of how context shapes barriers is of great importance in the disease. Adolescent reports of barriers to adherence have been studied, but studies of their parents' experience of such barriers have not yet been carried out. The aim of the present study was to explore barriers to treatment adherence identified by young patients with cystic fibrosis and by their parents.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A questionnaire survey of a cohort of young Danish patients with cystic fibrosis aged 14-25 years and their parents was undertaken.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Barriers to treatment adherence were reported by 60{\%} of the patients and by 62{\%} of their parents. Patients and parents agreed that the three most common barriers encountered were lack of time, forgetfulness, and unwillingness to take medication in public. We found a significant positive correlation between reported number of barriers and perceived treatment burden. We also found a statistically significant relationship between the reported number of barriers and treatment adherence. A significant association was found between the number of barriers and the reactions of adolescents/young adults and those of their mothers and fathers, and between the number of barriers and the way the family communicated about cystic fibrosis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The present study showed that the majority of adolescents with cystic fibrosis and their parents experienced barriers to treatment adherence. Agreement between adolescents and their parents regarding the level and types of barriers indicates an opportunity for close cooperation between adolescents, their parents, and health care professionals in overcoming adolescent adherence problems.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to monitor medication adherence in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and its correlation with disease severity and patient age. Methods: Children less than 12 years of age (group 1) and adolescents 12 years of age and older (group 2) were recruited from the University of Michigan CF Center. The study duration was 3 months. A total of 22 patients per group were enrolled. Adherence to ADEKs, an oral multivitamin, and dornase alfa, a nebulized mucolytic medication, was monitored. Adherence to ADEKs was monitored by using the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS) SmartCaps (APREX, AARDx, Inc., Union City, California). Dornase alfa adherence rate was monitored by counting empty medication vials. Results: Thirty-three patients completed the study, 15 patients in group 1 and 18 patients in group 2. The overall mean adherence rates for ADEKs and dornase alfa were (± SD) 63.6{\%} ± 24.0{\%} and 66.5{\%} ± 31.2{\%}, respectively. The median ADEKs and dornase alfa adherence rate for group 1 was 84.6{\%} and 79.1{\%}, respectively (p = .08); and for group 2 was 56.7{\%} vs. 78.4{\%}, respectively (p = .07). There was a trend toward significance, suggesting that the adherence rate for ADEKs was higher than for dornase alfa (p = .08) in group 1. Group 2 showed a trend toward adherence to dornase alfa than to ADEKs (p = .07). There was a trend for ADEKs adherence between groups 1 and 2 (p = .09), but not for dornase alfa (p = .93). Conclusion: Parental supervision and disease severity are likely to play a major role in adherence to medical management. Partnership with patients and families about the treatment plan might be important for improving adherence rate. The MEMS SmartCaps is an electronic monitoring technology that should be used to measure drug adherence objectively both in further larger clinical trials and in the outpatient setting. © 2006 Society for Adolescent Medicine.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-adherence to prescribed treatments is the primary cause of treatment failure in pediatric long-term conditions. Greater understanding of parents and caregivers' reasons for non-adherence can help to address this problem and improve outcomes for children with long-term conditions.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We carried out a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies. Medline, Embase, Cinahl and PsycInfo were searched for relevant studies published in English and German between 1996 and 2011. Papers were included if they contained qualitative data, for example from interviews or focus groups, reporting the views of parents and caregivers of children with a range of long-term conditions on their treatment adherence. Papers were quality assessed and analysed using thematic synthesis.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Nineteen papers were included reporting 17 studies with caregivers from 423 households in five countries. Long-term conditions included; asthma, cystic fibrosis, HIV, diabetes and juvenile arthritis. Across all conditions caregivers were making on-going attempts to balance competing concerns about the treatment (such as perceived effectiveness or fear of side effects) with the condition itself (for instance perceived long-term threat to child). Although the barriers to implementing treatment regimens varied across the different conditions (including complexity and time-consuming nature of treatments, un-palatability and side-effects of medications), it was clear that caregivers worked hard to overcome these day-to-day challenges and to deal with child resistance to treatments. Yet, carers reported that strict treatment adherence, which is expected by health professionals, could threaten their priorities around preserving family relationships and providing a 'normal life' for their child and any siblings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment adherence in long-term pediatric conditions is a complex issue which needs to be seen in the context of caregivers balancing the everyday needs of the child within everyday family life. Health professionals may be able to help caregivers respond positively to the challenge of treatment adherence for long-term conditions by simplifying treatment regimens to minimise impact on family life and being aware of difficulties around child resistance and supportive of strategies to attempt to overcome this. Caregivers would also welcome help with communicating with children about treatment goals.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: It is likely that nonadherence to treatment is one mediator of the effect of psychological factors on disease activity and course of cystic fibrosis. Nonadherence is a significant problem for patients with the disease. This review assesses adherence to multiple treatment components in cystic fibrosis and identifies factors associated with poor adherence. Based on this assessment, strategies aimed at enhancing adherence will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: Adherence to treatment occurs less than 50{\%} of the time in patients with cystic fibrosis, indicating poor adherence, which is particularly common in adolescents. Factors associated with poor adherence include psychiatric, psychological and emotional factors; family issues; and treatment-related problems. Recently, more information is being gathered regarding processes related to poor adherence. SUMMARY: Psychological factors affecting physical conditions frequently occur in children with cystic fibrosis. Therefore, patients need to be routinely screened for coexisting psychosocial issues and treatment adherence problems. Adherence needs to be examined according to the specific treatment component, and with an understanding of factors that make adherence difficult for patients and families. This will enable healthcare teams to target individualized strategies to counteract nonadherence, with emphasis on the role of psychological and psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {Background: Adherence rates for chronic pediatric conditions are approximately 50{\%}. The primary objective of the study was to assess rates of adherence using four different measurement methods for children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Methods: Participants included 37 children with CF between 6 and 13 years of age and their primary caregivers. Adherence measures included parent and child self-reports, diary data, pharmacy refill history, and electronic monitors. Results: Results suggested that rates of adherence varied by treatment component and across measurement methods. However, when examining more objective measures, rates of overall adherence were below 50{\%} for children with CF, indicating generally poor adherence to the treatment regimen. For example, rates of adherence to enzyme medications, using electronic and diary measures, ranged from 27{\%} to 46{\%}. Conclusions: The multi-method measurement approach provided unique information regarding rates of adherence for each disease condition by type of treatment component. Accurately measuring rates of treatment adherence for children with CF is an important step in developing effective interventions to influence these behaviors. © 2006 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

As with other segments of the population, it has been difficult to devise exercise programs to which most patients will adhere for long periods of time. In healthy children, factors that are related to positive exercise compliance include social support, perceptions of competency and self-esteem, enjoyment of activity, and availability of a variety of activities. In patients with CF, complications associated with the disease, e.g., time required for other treatment and fatigue, make compliance with recommended exercise activities more difficult. Factors likely to increase compliance in this population include explicit and continued encouragement and support from the family and healthcare team, and the introduction of behavior-changing strategies.},

Using one such device, we have monitored nebulised antibiotic adherence in children with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). Methods: In CF children infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, downloaded data from an AAD device was used to calculate morning, evening and overall monthly adherence to antibiotic therapy over a year. Results: Overall monthly adherence to nebulised antibiotic therapy in 28 children was maintained between 60 and 70{\%} over the year. Considerable variation in adherence, both between and within patients, was evident (Mean [SD] coefficient of variation, 37[44]{\%}). Evening adherence (75[37]{\%}) was better than morning adherence (58[34]{\%}: p = 0.012). Treatment regimens were changed in 8/28 patients based on adherence data. Conclusions: Routine adherence monitoring can be implemented in an outpatient setting.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Problems with sleep, eating and adherence to therapy may adversely affect health outcomes in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). Data on the prevalence of such problems, associated parenting styles and caregiver mental health are limited. AIMS: To determine: (a) the prevalence of sleep, mealtime, therapy adherence and externalising and internalising behavioural problems in preschool children with CF; (b) the prevalence of caregiver mental health problems and poor sleep quality; and (c) associations between child behavioural problems and parenting styles. METHODS: This was a cross sectional survey of caregivers of children aged 6 months to 5 years attending CF outpatient clinics at Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne), Monash Medical Centre (Melbourne) and Sydney Children's Hospital. Main outcome measures were child externalising and internalising behaviours, sleep, eating and adherence with therapy; the predictor was parenting styles (harsh, inconsistent, overprotective). RESULTS: 117 of 139 families participated. Problems were common with child sleep (small PROBLEM: 31.6{\%}; moderate/large problem: 21.9{\%}), eating (32.4{\%}) and adherence with physiotherapy (50.4{\%}). Compared to normative data, sleep and mealtime problems were more prevalent. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicating depression (33.3{\%}), anxiety (16.4{\%}) and stress (34.2{\%}). Harsh parenting was associated with internalising behaviours (adjusted OR 3.9, 95{\%} CI 1.16 to 13.17, p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Problems with sleeping, eating and physiotherapy adherence were common in preschool children with CF. Caregivers reported high rates of symptoms indicative of mental health problems. Harsh parenting was associated with internalising problems. An intervention targeting child problem behaviours and parental mental health would be appropriate for CF families.},
